# Project Summary {.unnumbered}

Current influenza vaccines fail to project against novel strains. The
development of a universal influenza vaccine is hindered by a current lack
of understanding of factors driving variation in the immune response to
influenza. We will use longitudinal cohort data from multiple sources to
explore how characteristics of vaccines interact with characteristics of the
vaccine recipient in order to clarify potential drivers and mechanisms of the
immune response to vaccination. Understanding such drivers will allow for
precise evaluation and targeted development of universal vaccine candidates.
We aim to explore how antigenic differences between the vaccine strain and
historical strains (a surrogate for potential future strains) interact with
the preexisting immune repertoire of the recipient, and how vaccine dose and
prior vaccination history can modulate this relationship. In addition, we will
propose metrics for the fair evaluation of vaccine candidates to a wide
variety of historical strains, which can allow the selection of an optimal
broadly reactive vaccine.

# Project Narrative {.unnumbered}

Influenza is a respiratory disease that occurs in seasonal epidemics worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual vaccination against seasonal influenza with a modified vaccine for adults in the United States, but the effectiveness of these vaccines varies greatly across seasons and individuals. Improved understanding of the drivers of the immune response following vaccination is crucial for improving influenza vaccines.
