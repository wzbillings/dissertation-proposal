Zane Billings, Andreas Handel, et al.

## Overview

This repository contains all code, exploratory data analysis,
figure/table generation, and text for my **dissertation proposal**,
which I will interchangeably call my **prospectus.** From my
department’s handbook:

> The proposal will include research goals and aims, background and
> rationale, literature review, detailed description of methods
> proposed, and an analytic strategy.

## File structure

## Aims

**Aim 1.** [soulful-snake](https://github.com/wzbillings/soulful-snake). Relationship between vaccine response and pre-existing immunity, modulation by vaccine dose, and comparison to Veronika's models.

**Aim 2.** [khaki-kite](https://github.com/wzbillings/khaki-kite). Antigenic distance, followup to Amanda's paper. Potentially modeling response with antigenic distance or comparing summary measures of breadth. 

**Aim 3.** [gross-grouse](https://github.com/wzbillings/gross-grouse). Causal modeling of flu vaccine response or protection using DIVERsity data, Andrea Sant's data, Ted's Data, and/or Ben Cowling's data.
