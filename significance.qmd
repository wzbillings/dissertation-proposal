# SIGNIFICANCE

<!-- overview PG -->
The rapid evolution and seasonal circulation of influenza create a susceptible
population with incredibly heterogeneous immune repertoires. Several factors
are known to influence baseline immunity to a particular immune strain:
birth year, via an imprinting effect; age, via immunosenescence; demographic
characteristics like age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status; and an
individual's path-dependent history of influenza exposure. Individuals are
exposed to influenza through either infection of vaccination several times
over their lives, and exposure to varying strains leads to the development of
a unique memory response which can be extremely different for two otherwise
similar individuals.

As influenza continues to evolve and circulate, the development of a universal
influenza vaccine which can protect against future strains is a strategy
for preventing the next influenza pandemic. However, the rapid evolution and seasonal circulation of influenza create a susceptible
population with incredibly heterogeneous immune repertoires. Two ostensibly
similar individuals can receive drastically different levels of immune protection
from the same vaccine. 

Introductory paragraph should:
* Establish that flu is a problem and a universal vaccine is a solution
* Establish that we do not compeltely understand the immune response to
influenza, and determining drivers of the response is crucial for vaccine design.
* Establish that specifically antigenic distance, dose, and preimmunity are
drivers of the response.

<!-- aim 1 PG -->
**Aim 1. Develop metrics for the quantification of the total immune response to an influenza vaccine, incorporating both strength and breadth.**

<!-- aim 2 PG -->
**Aim 2. Quantify the effect of vaccine dose on the effect of the vaccine after accounting for pre-existing immunity and antigenic distance.**

<!-- aim 3 PG -->
**Aim 3. Determine whether antigenic distance is a sufficient single measurement of difference between viral strains in the context of vaccination.**
