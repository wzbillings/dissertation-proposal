# SIGNIFICANCE

Influenza rapidly evolves to escape current vaccines through two major
mechanisms: antigenic drift and shift [@kim2018;
@petrova2017]. Antigenic drift is the gradual process of accumulating mutations,
driven by host selective pressure and the low fidelity rate of the influenza
polymerase. Antigenic shifts are sudden and abrupt changes in influenza
antigens, which occur by recombination with antigenically distant strains. See
@fig-driftshift.

#| escape due to drift is a gradual process that can be palliated by
#| annual reformulation of vaccines, escape due to shift is a relatively
#| quick process that can lead to epidemic or even pandemic spread of influenza
#| before there is time to develop and administer a new vaccine."

All currently available seasonal influenza vaccines focus on four lineages of
influenza, which are predicted to be the dominant circulating strains for the
upcoming season. The seasonal vaccine is thus often ineffective at preventing
infection by new antigens that arise spontaneously from spillover events,
leading to pandemics like the 2009 H1N1 outbreak [@trifonov2009]. The highly
pathogenic H5N1 spillover cases in early 2023 [@cdc2023] acutely demonstrate the
need for a *universal* influenza vaccine that is broadly protective, and
provides protection against emergent strains. Furthermore, seasonal epidemic
influenza still has a substantive burden [@bolek2023; @cdc2021; @sullivan2019],
especially in children and older adults [@li2023; @lozano2012]. Vaccine
effectiveness (VE) varies widely, and is typically lower when strains selected
for inclusion in seasonal vaccines do not match the strains which actually
circulate [@erbelding2018; @belongia2016; @okoli2021]. Even when strains are
correctly matched, VE rarely exceeds 50%.

Unfortunately, designing a universal influenza vaccine is challenging [@wei2020;
@vogel2020; @henry2018]. Understanding the immune response to influenza is a
major landmark for improving vaccine design, but is
complicated by the frequent antigenic innovations of influenza. Since the immune response to a vaccine depends on an individual's history of infection and vaccination events (@fig-het-pop), the susceptible
population contains incredibly diverse immune repertoires, even after
controlling for imprinting effects and prior vaccination. Decomposing the
immune response to novel influenza strains is an open
problem. Dissecting the components of the response would yield key insights into
the design of vaccines which are reliably broadly protective for individuals
regardless of their immune state at time of vaccination [@erbelding2018].

#| vaccination. Each individual also expresses variability in their immune
#| state at the time of exposure, leading to different responses, and thus
#| different immune repertoires, even if the path of exposure is identical."

## Aim 1

There is no universally accepted method for quantifying the overall strength of
the immune response induced by a vaccine candidate. Since direct trials of
efficacy are expensive, correlates of protection (CoP) are measured instead.
Several CoPs are currently used to test the efficacy of influenza vaccine
candidates, but there is no consensus on which, if any, are best [@krammer2019].
The most common CoP used in practice is the *hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)
titer*. We will focus on HAI titer in this project, but the methods we propose
could be applied to any quantitative CoP.

HAI is correlated with protection from influenza with a 50% protection titer of
1:40 [@hobson1972; @coudeville2010]. If an individual's reciprocal titer is 40
or greater for a particular strain of influenza, the individual is said to be
*seroprotected* against that strain. If a vaccine induces a 4-fold or greater
increase in HAI titer, with the final post-vaccination measurement above 40, the
individual is said to have *seroconverted* against that strain. Seroconversion
and seroprotection are commonly used dichotomous clinical endpoints for
assessing the immunogenicity of an influenza vaccine candidate. An assay using the
vaccine strain is said to be *homologous*, while an assay using any other
strain is said to be *heterologous*.

Many vaccine studies only measure the immune response to homologous strains,
which we will call the **magnitude** of the response.
However, to evaluate a broadly reactive universal vaccine candidate, we also
need to measure the induced immune response to heterologous strains,
which we call the **breadth** of the response. We can compare universal
vaccine candidates using some weighted combination of magnitude and breadth,
which we call the **overall strength** of the response.

Previous studies have evaluated the overall strength of individual immune
responses after vaccination by running panel of assays using multiple
heterologous strains (@fig-het-hai). The breadth of the response is then taken
as either the count or proportion of strains to which the individual
seroconverted [@allen2021; @dugan2020]. While this method is easy to quantify in
a laboratory setting, the estimates of breadth are biased by the selection of
the panel of heterologous strains and do not take *antigenic distance* into
account. Antigenic distance is a metric for describing how similar two strains
of influenza should appear to the immune system. Using the proportion of
seroconverted strains metric, one vaccine candidate could appear to be more
broadly protective than another simply because one lab chose a panel of strains
which were less antigenically distant on average. Such variation in panels
between research groups makes comparing these breadth estimates across studies
difficult [@einav2020].

#| after vaccination indicates the degree to which vaccination elicited
#| immune responses to particular strains."

```

Modern methods for assessing the antigenic distance between strains of influenza
allow the development of a consistent framework for assessing the breadth of a
vaccine candidate. The simplest method for computing antigenic distance is the
*time-based* method, where the antigenic distance is taken as the difference in
isolation year between strains [@yang2020; @auladell2022]. Other methods include
*sequence-based* methods, which assess the similarity of the genetic or protein
sequence of the two strains [@smith2004a; @gupta2006; @nachbagauer2017;
@anderson2018; @forghani2020]; and *antigen-based methods*, which use
immunogenicity data to inform distance between strains [@fonville2014;
@fonville2015; @kucharski2018;  @hinojosa2020; @wang2021]. There is no clear
consensus on which measures of distance are most useful for informing vaccine
evaluation. An individual's responses to a panel of virus strains can be
plotted against antigenic distance, forming an *antibody
landscape* (@fig-landscape-example). While previous work has explored the
quantitative comparison of antibody landscapes [@yang2020], such approaches have
not been widely utilized.

```{r}
#| label: fig-landscape-example
#| out-width: 6.25in
#| fig-cap: "We can model an individual's immune response to viral strains as
#| a function of antigenic distance, creating an antibody landscape. A
#| broadly reactive vaccine will have a post-vaccination (for example, day 28)
#| antibody landscape which is higher than the pre-vaccination (day 0) landscape,
#| even for distant strains. A hypothetical universal influenza vaccine would
#| have a post-vaccination landscape that is uniformly higher than the
#| pre-vaccination landscape, as shown here, eliciting a response to all
#| comparable influenza strains."

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figures", "Schematics", "landscape-example.png"))
```

We will develop methods for quantifying the magnitude, strength, and overall
breadth of a vaccine response from individual antibody landscapes. Using our
framework for vaccine evaluation, we will compare measures of antigenic
distance. We also plan to test the robustness of our metric to the selection of
the virus panel in order to compare our framework to the traditional method. We
will explore simple regression models, flexible spline models, and functional
data analytic techniques for their potential to characterize the overall
strength and breadth of the immune response (@fig-landscape-fits). For this aim,
we will use longitudinal cohort data with a wide panel of heterologous responses
for each individual collected by Ted Ross [@nunez2017; @forst2022; @wu2022].

```{r}
#| label: fig-landscape-fits
#| out-width: 6.25in
#| fig-cap: "In a vaccine cohort study, we can take immune measurements for a
#| panel of heterologous viruses from many individuals. Each of these

#| might be representative of the response we expect to see from this vaccine
#| candidate. The black line here is a linear statistical model, while the
#| dashed red line is a potential nonlinear statistical model. We then hope
#| to summarize these typical landscapes to obtain metrics for vaccine candidate
#| comparison that balance the magnitude of the response with the breadth of

## Aim 2

Several characteristics of the vaccine and the recipient are associated with the
immune response to the vaccine (@fig-drivers). In addition to antigenic distance
between the vaccine strain and the strain of interest,vaccine dose [@lee2018;
@wilkinson2017; @diazgranados2014], route of administration [@carter2019;
@kenney2004; @muhamed2006], and type [@richards2020;
@gouma2020a; @nachbagauer2021] are associated with the overall strength of the
immune response. Promising vaccine candidates have been developed using
intranasal, intramuscular, and subdermal routes of administration, and
recombinant protein or mRNA vaccines may prove to be superior to the traditional
split-inactivated or live attenuated vaccine types.

In addition to vaccine design choices, baseline characteristics of the vaccine
recipient (the host) can alter the vaccine response. These characteristics can
vary between every member of the susceptible population, or be aggregable at the
population level. Genetic differences [@brodin2015; @franco2013;
@orru2013], epigenetic modifications, and differential gene expression
[@henn2013;
@hipc2017; @keshavarz2021; @wimmers2021; @zimmermann2016; @forst2022], all fall
into the former category. In the latter category are individual characteristics
like sex, obesity, and age.

```

Birth sex and circulating hormones may influence the immune response to flu
through sex-associated genetic differences and through sex-differentiated
hormonal signaling, although results are ambiguous with no mechanism yet
discovered [@klein2016; @fink2018; @voigt2019;@gabriel2014;@chambers2018].
Obesity, typically measured through BMI, is associated with a decreased response
or with more rapid waning of antibodies [@honce2019]. As individuals age, they
undergo immunosenescence and a gradual decline in immune protection [@dugan2020;
@goodwin2006].

In addition to the immunosenescence effect of age, an individual's birth year is
predictive of the immune response to specific strains of influenza, because
birth year is strongly associated with the first strain of influenza to which an
individual is exposed [@gostic2016; @gostic2019; @arevalo2020]. The theory of
imprinting (also called original antigenic sin) predicts that an individual's
first influenza exposure leads to the development of a memory response to that
strain. Future exposures can then activate the memory response to the original
strain (assuming the strains are somewhat similar), which dominates the novel
immune response to the new strain, as influenza antibodies reach a saturation
level called the "antibody ceiling", which can vary between individuals
[@hay2019; @hansen2021; @jacobson2015]

One consequence of the imprinting effect and of the antibody ceiling effect is a
strong negative relationship between pre-vaccination immunity and the response
to a vaccine [@zost2017; @gouma2020a]. Prior and repeat vaccination also has a
strong effect on vaccine response [@dugan2020; @mclean2018], potentially
independent of the antibody ceiling effect. In fact, the reactivation of the
memory response at every exposure to a somewhat similar strain makes the
response to vaccination dependent on an individual's entire history of influenza
infection and vaccination [@auladell2022;
@kucharski2015;@kucharski2018;@hay2019]. In addition, the immune response to
influenza may be affected by prior exposure to other pathogens, including
herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus [@souquette2018] or cytomegalovirus
[@furman2015], or through antigen-independent effects which modify the baseline
immune state and induce a differential response [@tsang2014].

While measuring all of these effects simultaneously is impossible, we intend to
model the effects of vaccine dose, pre-vaccination titer, prior vaccination, and
antigenic distance using data from the cohort studies conducted by Ted Ross.
While our analysis will be limited to a single vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur's
FluZone, with standard and high dose formulations), we have data on an extensive
panel of historical viruses along with reported vaccination history for each
patient. We will incorporate predictive machine learning approaches and
hierarchical bayesian modeling to understand the individual contributions of
these factors to the overall immune response. We also plan to modify
previously-developed mechanistic models for multiple influenza epitope responses
[@zarnitsyna2015; @zarnitsyna2016; @desikan2022] to include a degree of
similarity between epitopes (conceptually representing antigenic distance), and
compare the results from the updated model to our data.
 
## Aim 3

The role of vaccine dose is so important in vaccine response that determining a
dose that balances efficacy and side effects is a crucial part of drug approval
in the United States [@wei2020; @erbelding2018; @benest2021]. High-dose
influenza vaccines are approved for use in older adults and can substantially
improve the immune response for older and otherwise immunocompromised
individuals [@cowling2020; @diazgranados2014; @chang2019]. While otherwise
healthy recipients generate substantive immune responses even to fractional
doses of influenza vaccine [@engler2008; @coleman2012], mechanistic models
predict that increased dose may be useful in overcoming the negative effects of
prior immunity and original antigenic sin [@zarnitsyna2015; @zarnitsyna2016].

These mechanistic models allow for simulation of the immune response following
vaccination for a wide range of inoculum doses, and predict that as the inoculum
dose is increased, the effect of prevaccination titer is mitigated. That is, an
individual with a higher prevaccination titer could potentially receive a higher
dose than an individual with a low prevaccination titer, and observe the same
fold-change in titer as a result of vaccination. To date, a randomized clinical
trial comparing standard and high dose formulations of available vaccines has
not been conducted in otherwise healthy adults 18 - 49, so these claims
have not yet been evaluated in groups that are not elderly or immunocompromised.

We will combine observational data from multiple sources to estimate the effect
of dose on influenza vaccine response while controlling for the effects of
prevaccination titer, age, and other relevant effects as enumerated previously
(@fig-dose-age). In this analysis, we specifically plan to focus on the effect
of dose on homologous vaccine response by combining the UGAFluVac data, where
high dose vaccines were only administered to individuals aged 65 or older, with
data collected by Angela Branche and Andrea Sant [@gouma2020a; @moritzky2022].
We will obtain the average causal effect of dose, after controlling for age and
other confounders, and compare the predictions to those of the mechanistic
model, which does not currently account for age. Together, these analyses will
provide a better substantive understanding of the effect of dose on the
immunogenicity of a standard influenza vaccine.
