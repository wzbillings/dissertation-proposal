  abstract = {Influenza is a highly contagious viral pathogen with more than 200,000 cases reported in the United States during the 2017\textendash 2018 season. Annual vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization, with the goal to reduce influenza severity and transmission. Currently available vaccines are about 60\% effective, and vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season, as well as between different influenza subtypes within a single season. Immunological imprinting from early-life influenza infection can prominently shape the immune response to subsequent infections. Here, the impact of preexisting B cell memory in the response to quadrivalent influenza vaccine was assessed using blood samples collected from healthy subjects (18\textendash 85 years old) prior to and 21\textendash 28 days following influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination increased both HA-specific antibodies and memory B cell frequency. Despite no apparent differences in antigenicity between vaccine components, most individuals were biased toward one of the vaccine strains. Specifically, responses to H3N2 were reduced in magnitude relative to the other vaccine components. Overall, this study unveils a potentially new mechanism underlying differential vaccine effectiveness against distinct influenza subtypes.,  , People are imprinted with a bias to one of the four seasonal influenza subtypes that persists following seasonal influenza vaccination.},

  abstract = {Each person has a unique immune history to past influenza virus infections. Exposure to influenza viruses early in life establishes memory B cell populations that influence future immune responses to influenza vaccination. Current influenza vaccines elicit antibodies that are typically strain specific and do not offer broad protection against antigenically drifted influenza strains in all age groups of people. This is particularly true for vaccine antigens of the A(H3N2) influenza virus subtype, where continual antigenic drift necessitates frequent vaccine reformulation. Broadly-reactive influenza virus vaccine antigens offer a solution to combat antigenic drift, but they also need to be equally effective in all populations, regardless of prior influenza virus exposure history. This study examined the role that pre-existing immunity plays on influenza virus vaccination. Ferrets were infected with historical A(H3N2) influenza viruses isolated from either the 1970's, 1980's, or 1990's and then vaccinated with computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRA) or wild-type (WT) influenza virus like particles (VLPs) expressing hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine antigens to examine the expansion of immune breadth. Vaccines with the H3 COBRA HA antigens had more cross-reactive antibodies following a single vaccination in all three pre-immune regimens than vaccines with WT H3 HA antigens against historical, contemporary, and future drifted A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The H3 COBRA HA vaccines also induced antibodies capable of neutralizing live virus infections against modern drifted A(H3N2) strains at higher titers than the WT H3 HA vaccine comparators.},

  abstract = {Human antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus is limited by antigenic drift resulting from amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain. Glycan addition can cause large antigenic changes but is limited by fitness costs to viral replication. Here, we report that glycans are added to H1 and H3 HAs at discrete 5-to-7-year intervals, until they reach a functional glycan limit, after which glycans are swapped at approximately 2-fold-longer intervals. Consistent with this pattern, 2009 pandemic H1N1 added a glycan at residue N162 over the 2015-2016 season, an addition that required two epistatic HA head mutations for complete glycosylation. These strains rapidly replaced H1N1 strains globally, by 2017 dominating H3N2 and influenza B virus strains for the season. The pattern of glycan modulation that we outline should aid efforts for tracing the epidemic potential of evolving human IAV strains.IMPORTANCE Frequent mutation of its major antibody target, the glycoprotein hemagglutinin, ensures that the influenza virus is perennially both a rapidly emerging virus and a major threat to public health. One type of mutation escapes immunity by adding a glycan onto an area of hemagglutinin that many antibodies recognize. This study revealed that these glycan changes follow a simple temporal pattern. Every 5 to 7 years, hemagglutinin adds a new glycan, up to a limit. After this limit is reached, no net additions of glycans occur. Instead, glycans are swapped or lost at longer intervals. Eventually, a pandemic replaces the terminally glycosylated hemagglutinin with a minimally glycosylated one from the animal reservoir, restarting the cycle. This pattern suggests the following: (i) some hemagglutinins are evolved for this decades-long process, which is both defined by and limited by successive glycan addition; and (ii) hemagglutinin's antibody dominance and its capacity for mutations are highly adapted features that allow influenza to outpace our antibody-based immunity.},

  abstract = {The antibody repertoire possesses near-limitless diversity, enabling the adaptive immune system to accommodate essentially any antigen. However, this diversity explores the antigenic space unequally, allowing some pathogens like influenza virus to impose complex immunodominance hierarchies that distract antibody responses away from key sites of virus vulnerability. We developed a computational model of affinity maturation to map the patterns of immunodominance that evolve upon immunization with natural and engineered displays of hemagglutinin (HA), the influenza vaccine antigen. Based on this knowledge, we designed immunization protocols that subvert immune distraction and focus serum antibody responses upon a functionally conserved, but immunologically recessive, target of human broadly neutralizing antibodies. We tested in silico predictions by vaccinating transgenic mice in which antibody diversity was humanized to mirror clinically relevant humoral output. Collectively, our results demonstrate that complex patterns in antibody immunogenicity can be rationally defined and then manipulated to elicit engineered immunity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ease at which influenza virus sequence data can be used to estimate antigenic relationships between strains and the existence of databases containing sequence data for hundreds of thousands influenza strains make sequence-based antigenic distance estimates an attractive approach to researchers. Antigenic mismatch between circulating strains and vaccine strains results in significantly decreased vaccine effectiveness. Furthermore, antigenic relatedness between the vaccine strain and the strains an individual was originally primed with can affect the cross-reactivity of the antibody response. Thus, understanding the antigenic relationships between influenza viruses that have circulated is important to both vaccinologists and immunologists. RESULTS: Here we develop a method of mapping antigenic relationships between influenza virus stains using a sequence-based antigenic distance approach (SBM). We used a modified version of the p-all-epitope sequence-based antigenic distance calculation, which determines the antigenic relatedness between strains using influenza hemagglutinin (HA) genetic coding sequence data and provide experimental validation of the p-all-epitope calculation. We calculated the antigenic distance between 4838 H1N1 viruses isolated from infected humans between 1918 and 2016. We demonstrate, for the first time, that sequence-based antigenic distances of H1N1 Influenza viruses can be accurately represented in 2-dimenstional antigenic cartography using classic multidimensional scaling. Additionally, the model correctly predicted decreases in cross-reactive antibody levels with 87\% accuracy and was highly reproducible with even when small numbers of sequences were used. CONCLUSION: This work provides a highly accurate and precise bioinformatics tool that can be used to assess immune risk as well as design optimized vaccination strategies. SBM accurately estimated the antigenic relationship between strains using HA sequence data. Antigenic maps of H1N1 virus strains reveal that strains cluster antigenically similar to what has been reported for H3N2 viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genetic variation differs across antigenic sites and discuss the implications.},

  abstract = {Generating a broadly protective influenza vaccine is critical to global health. Understanding how immune memory influences influenza immunity is central to this goal. We undertook an in-depth study of the B cell response to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine over consecutive years. Analysis of monoclonal Abs generated from vaccine-induced plasmablasts demonstrated that individuals with low preexisting serological titers to the vaccinating strain generated a broadly reactive, HA stalk-biased, response. Higher preexisting serum antibody levels correlated with a strain-specific HA head-dominated response. We demonstrate that this HA head immunodominance encompasses poor accessibility of the HA stalk epitopes. Further, we show polyreactivity of HA stalk-reactive antibodies that could cause counterselection of these cells. Thus, preexisting memory against HA head epitopes predominate, inhibiting a broadly protective response against the HA stalk upon revaccination with similar strains. Consideration of influenza exposure history is critical for new vaccine strategies designed to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

  abstract = {Immunity to influenza viruses can be long-lived, but reinfections with antigenically distinct viral strains and subtypes are common. Reinfections can boost antibody responses against viral strains first encountered in childhood through a process termed "original antigenic sin." It is unknown how initial childhood exposures affect the induction of antibodies against the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain of influenza viruses. This is an important consideration since broadly reactive HA stalk antibodies can protect against infection, and universal vaccine platforms are being developed to induce these antibodies. Here we show that experimentally infected ferrets and naturally infected humans establish strong "immunological imprints" against HA stalk antigens first encountered during primary influenza virus infections. We found that HA stalk antibodies are surprisingly boosted upon subsequent infections with antigenically distinct influenza A virus subtypes. Paradoxically, these heterosubtypic-boosted HA stalk antibodies do not bind efficiently to the boosting influenza virus strain. Our results demonstrate that an individual's HA stalk antibody response is dependent on the specific subtype of influenza virus that they first encounter early in life. We propose that humans are susceptible to heterosubtypic influenza virus infections later in life since these viruses boost HA stalk antibodies that do not bind efficiently to the boosting antigen.},

The impact of memory induced by prior infection is rarely considered and is difficult to ascertain, because infections are often subclinical. This study investigated influenza vaccination among adults from the Ha Nam cohort (Vietnam), who were purposefully selected to include 72 with and 28 without documented influenza A(H3N2) infection during the preceding 9 years (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 12621000110886). The primary outcome was the effect of prior influenza A(H3N2) infection on hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody responses induced by a locally available influenza vaccine administered in November 2016. Baseline and postvaccination sera were titrated against 40 influenza A(H3N2) strains spanning 1968-2018. At each time point (baseline, day 14 and day 280), geometric mean antibody titers against 2008-2018 strains were higher among participants with recent infection (34 (29-40), 187 (154-227) and 86 (72-103)) than among participants without recent infection (19 (17-22), 91 (64-130) and 38 (30-49)). On days 14 and 280, mean titer rises against 2014-2018 strains were 6.1-fold (5.0- to 7.4-fold) and 2.6-fold (2.2- to 3.1-fold) for participants with recent infection versus 4.8-fold (3.5- to 6.7-fold) and 1.9-fold (1.5- to 2.3-fold) for those without.

The range of A(H3N2) viruses recognized by vaccine-induced antibodies was associated with the prior infection strain. These results suggest that recall of immunological memory induced by prior infection enhances antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccine and is important to attain protective antibody titers.},

Six mAbs exhibited very potent neutralizing activity (IC50 {$<$} 200 ng/ml) against the H3N2v virus but not against current human H3N2 circulating strains. Fine epitope mapping and structural characterization of antigen-antibody complexes revealed that H3N2v specificity was attributable to amino acid polymorphisms in the 150-loop and the 190-helix antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin protein. H3N2v-specific antibodies also neutralized human H3N2 influenza strains naturally circulating between 1995 and 2005. These results reveal a high level of antigenic relatedness between the swine H3N2v virus and previously circulating human strains, consistent with the fact that early human H3 seasonal strains entered the porcine population in the 1990s and reentered the human population, where they had not been circulating, as H3N2v about a decade later. The data also explain the increased susceptibility to H3N2v viruses in young children, who lack prior exposure to human seasonal strains from the 1990s.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Corona pandemic and ongoing mass vaccinations raise the question of the nocebo mechanisms involved. Since immunization is usually administered to healthy people as a preventive health measure, adverse events (AE) following immunization are less accepted and could contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Assuming that vaccinees experience nocebo responses, the aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect sizes of solicited adverse events (or assumed reactogenicity) reported in placebo groups in RCTs on seasonal influenza vaccination. METHODS: Literature search via PubMed, Web of Science, and CENTRAL was conducted considering gray literature. Only RCTs with placebo groups using pharmacologically inert substances (like saline) were included. Quality was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool. Effect sizes were estimated using a random mixed effects model based on k~=~31 studies covering 14,326 participants in placebo groups. RESULTS: Reported solicited AEs in placebo groups showed significant effect sizes of proportions (ESp). In k~=~13 analyzed placebo groups, 35~\% of the participants reported at least one solicited systemic AE (p~=~0.007). The most common particular solicited systemic AEs were headache (k~=~27; 17~\%; p~=~0.001), malaise (k~=~13; 12~\%; p~=~0.004), and hyperhidrosis (k~=~4; 12~\%; p~{$<~$}0.001) within one week after vaccination. CONCLUSION: The results show significant solicited AEs in placebo groups, indicating substantial nocebo responses after vaccination. Based on the fact that most vaccination programs include similar groups of healthy people, we expect that comparable nocebo effects occur during other campaigns. Health care professionals should be aware of the nocebo response and take action to prevent or decrease the burden of adverse events following immunization. Fear of side effects must be addressed early in order to diminish vaccine hesitancy. Prospero identifier: CRD42020156287, October 2019.},

  abstract = {Background Influenza viruses cause substantial annual morbidity and mortality globally. Current vaccines protect against influenza only when well matched to the circulating strains. However, antigenic drift can cause considerable mismatches between vaccine and circulating strains, substantially reducing vaccine effectiveness. Moreover, current seasonal vaccines are ineffective against pandemic influenza, and production of a vaccine matched to a newly emerging virus strain takes months. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a broadly protective influenza virus vaccine. We aimed to test the ability of chimeric H1 haemagglutinin-based universal influenza virus vaccine candidates to induce broadly cross-reactive antibodies targeting the stalk domain of group 1 haemagglutinin-expressing influenza viruses. Methods We did a randomised, observer-blinded, phase 1 study in healthy adults in two centres in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three prime\textendash boost, chimeric haemagglutinin-based vaccine regimens or one of two placebo groups. The vaccine regimens included a chimeric H8/1, intranasal, live-attenuated vaccine on day 1 followed by a non-adjuvanted, chimeric H5/1, intramuscular, inactivated vaccine on day 85; the same regimen but with the inactivated vaccine being adjuvanted with AS03; and an AS03-adjuvanted, chimeric H8/1, intramuscular, inactivated vaccine followed by an AS03-adjuvanted, chimeric H5/1, intramuscular, inactivated vaccine. In this planned interim analysis, the primary endpoints of reactogenicity and safety were assessed by blinded study group. We also assessed anti-H1 haemagglutinin stalk, anti-H2, anti-H9, and anti-H18 IgG antibody titres and plasmablast and memory B-cell responses in peripheral blood. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03300050. Findings Between Oct 10, 2017, and Nov 27, 2017, 65 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned. The adjuvanted inactivated vaccine, but not the live-attenuated vaccine, induced a substantial serum IgG antibody response after the prime immunisation, with a seven times increase in anti-H1 stalk antibody titres on day 29. After boost immunisation, all vaccine regimens induced detectable anti-H1 stalk antibody (2{$\cdot$}2\textendash 5{$\cdot$}6 times induction over baseline), cross-reactive serum IgG antibody, and peripheral blood plasmablast responses. An unsolicited adverse event was reported for 29 (48\%) of 61 participants. Solicited local adverse events were reported in 12 (48\%) of 25 participants following prime vaccination with intramuscular study product or placebo, in 12 (33\%) of 36 after prime immunisation with intranasal study product or placebo, and in 18 (32\%) of 56 following booster doses of study product or placebo. Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 14 (56\%) of 25 after prime immunisation with intramuscular study product or placebo, in 22 (61\%) of 36 after immunisation with intranasal study product or placebo, and in 21 (38\%) of 56 after booster doses of study product or placebo. Disaggregated safety data were not available at the time of this interim analysis. Interpretation The tested chimeric haemagglutinin-based, universal influenza virus vaccine regimens elicited cross-reactive serum IgG antibodies that targeted the conserved haemagglutinin stalk domain. This is the first proof-of-principle study to show that high anti-stalk titres can be induced by a rationally designed vaccine in humans and opens up avenues for further development of universal influenza virus vaccines. On the basis of the blinded study group, the vaccine regimens were tolerable and no safety concerns were observed. Funding Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

Outcome variables were oxygen requirement, mechanical ventilation need, intensive care unit admission, and cost.~At least one viral pathogen was detected in 125 (47.7\%) of 262 patients who were included in the study. Fifty-five (20.9\%) of the patients were infected with influenza. Influenza-positive patients had higher rates for respiratory support, intensive care unit admission, and mortality compared to all other patients. The average cost of hospitalization per person was 2879.76 USD in the influenza-negative group, while the same cost was 3274.03 USD in the influenza-positive group. Although all of the vaccinated influenza-positive patients needed oxygen support, neither of them required invasive mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit admission. The average hospitalization cost per person was 779.70 USD in the vaccinated group compared to 3762.01 USD in the unvaccinated group. Disease-related direct cost of influenza in the community was estimated as 22\,776\,075.61 USD in the 18-65 years of age group and 15\,756\,120.02 USD in the 65 years of age and over group per year.~Influenza, compared to other respiratory virus infections, can lead to untoward clinical outcomes and mortality as well as higher direct medical costs in adults.},

Overall, lower respiratory disease from influenza is common; however, vaccine immunogenicity is low. Despite this, in some populations, influenza vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing severe disease. Various strategies to improve influenza vaccine immunogenicity have been attempted including two vaccine doses in the same influenza season, intradermal, adjuvanted, and high-dose vaccines. The timing of influenza vaccine is also important to achieve optimal immunogenicity. Given the suboptimal immunogenicity, family members and healthcare professionals involved in the care of these populations should be vaccinated.

In addition, some of these parameters become more variable with age, suggesting the cumulative influence of environmental exposure. Similarly, the serological responses to seasonal influenza vaccination are also determined largely by non-heritable factors, likely due to repeated exposure to different strains. Lastly, in MZ twins discordant for cytomegalovirus infection, more than half of all parameters are affected. These results highlight the largely reactive and adaptive nature of the immune system in healthy individuals.},

It has been challenging to disentangle how population-level patterns of humoral immunity change as a function of age, calendar year, and birth cohort from cross-sectional data alone. We analyzed 1,589 longitudinal sera samples from 260 children across three studies in Nicaragua, 2006\textendash 16. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were determined against four H3N2 strains, one H1N1 strain, and two H1N1pdm strains. We assessed temporal patterns of HAI titers using an age\textendash period\textendash cohort modeling framework. We found that titers against a given virus depended on calendar year of serum collection and birth cohort but not on age. Titer cohort patterns were better described by participants' ages relative to year of likely introduction of the virus's antigenic cluster than by age relative to year of strain introduction or by year of birth. These cohort effects may be driven by a decreasing likelihood of early-life infection after cluster introduction and by more broadly reactive antibodies at a young age. H3N2 and H1N1 viruses had qualitatively distinct cohort patterns, with cohort patterns of titers to specific H3N2 strains reaching their peak in children born 3 years prior to that virus's antigenic cluster introduction and with titers to H1N1 and H1N1pdm strains peaking for children born 1\textendash 2 years prior to cluster introduction but not being dramatically lower for older children. Ultimately, specific patterns of strain circulation and antigenic cluster introduction may drive population-level antibody titer patterns in children.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus infections leave a signature of immune memory that influences future responses to infections with antigenically related strains. It has been hypothesized that the first exposure in life to H1N1 influenza virus imprints the host immune system, potentially resulting in protection from severe infection with H5N1 later in life through hemagglutinin (HA) stalk-specific antibodies. To study the specific role of the HA on protection against infection without interference of cellular immunity or humoral antineuraminidase immunity, we primed mice with influenza B viruses that express an H1 HA (group 1; B-H1), H3 HA (group 2; B-H3), or wild-type influenza B virus and subsequently challenged them at different time points with an H5N1 virus. Weight loss and survival monitoring showed that the B-H1-primed mice exhibited better protection against H5N1 compared to the control mice. Analysis of H5-specific serum IgG, before and 21\,days after H5N1 challenge, evidenced the presence of anti-stalk H5 cross-reactive antibodies in the BH-1 group that were boosted by H5N1 infection. The increased immune responses and protection induced by priming with the B-H1 viruses lasted at least up to 1 year. Hence, a single HA priming based on natural infection induces long-lasting protective immunity against heterosubtypic strains from the same phylogenetic HA group in mice. This study gives mechanistic support to the earlier finding in humans that imprinting by H1 HA protects against H5N1 infections and that highly conserved regions on the HA, like the stalk, are involved in this phenomenon. IMPORTANCE Current studies point out that an HA-mediated immunological imprint is established early in life during the first exposure to influenza viruses, which critically shapes and biases future immune responses. However, studies in animal models are limited and the precise mechanisms of this phenomenon are under investigation. Studies that explore the effect of HA-specific immunity induced during natural infection on future exposures to heterosubtypic influenza strains are needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, but the currently licensed inactivated vaccines generally have low vaccine efficacies and could be improved. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we compared seasonal influenza vaccine regimens with different priming strategies, prime-boost intervals, and administration routes to determine the impact of these variables on the resulting antibody response. METHODS: Between August 17, 2012 and January 25, 2013, four sites enrolled healthy adults 18-70 years of age. Subjects were randomized to receive one of the following vaccination regimens: trivalent hemagglutinin (HA) DNA prime followed by trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) boost with a 3.5 month interval (DNA-IIV3), IIV3 prime followed by IIV3 boost with a 10 month interval (IIV3-IIV3), or concurrent DNA and IIV3 prime followed by IIV3 boost with a 10 month interval (DNA/IIV3-IIV3). Each regimen was additionally stratified by an IIV3 administration route of either intramuscular (IM) or intradermal (ID). DNA vaccines were administered by a needle-free jet injector (Biojector). Study objectives included evaluating the safety and tolerability of each regimen and measuring the antibody response by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). RESULTS: Three hundred and sixteen subjects enrolled. Local reactogenicity was mild to moderate in severity, with higher frequencies recorded following DNA vaccine administered by Biojector compared to IIV3 by either route (p {$<$}0.02 for pain, swelling, and redness) and following IIV3 by ID route compared to IM route (p {$<$}0.001 for swelling and redness). Systemic reactogenicity was similar between regimens. Though no overall differences were observed between regimens, the highest titers post boost were observed in the DNA-IIV3 group by ID route and in the IIV3-IIV3 group by IM route. CONCLUSIONS: All vaccination regimens were found to be safe and tolerable. While there were no overall differences between regimens, the DNA-IIV3 group by ID route, and the IIV3-IIV3 group by IM route, showed higher responses compared to the other same-route regimens.},

This study examined the safety and immunogenicity of a quadrivalent high-dose split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD). METHODS: This was a randomized, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial in healthy adults {$\geq$}65\,years of age. Subjects were randomized in a 4:1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular injection of IIV4-HD, the licensed IIV3-HD, or an IIV3-HD containing the alternate B-lineage strain. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), seroneutralisation, and anti-neuraminidase antibody titers were measured at baseline and day 28. Solicited reactions were collected for up to 7\,days, unsolicited adverse events up to 28\,days, and serious adverse events up to 180\,days. The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that IIV4-HD induces HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates that are non-inferior to those induced by IIV3-HD. Secondary objectives were to describe the safety of IIV4-HD and IIV3-HD and to demonstrate that IIV4-HD induces HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates that are superior to those induced by IIV3-HD not containing the same B-lineage strain. RESULTS: The study included 2670 adults {$\geq$}65\,years of age. For all four strains, HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates induced by IIV4-HD were non-inferior to those induced by IIV3-HDs containing the same strains. For both B strains, HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates induced by IIV4-HD were superior to those induced by IIV3-HD not containing the same B-lineage strain. Seroneutralisation and anti-neuraminidase antibody responses, measured in a subset of subjects, were similar. No new safety concerns were identified, and the safety profiles of IIV4-HD and IIV3-HD were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a second B strain in IIV4-HD resulted in improved immunogenicity against the added strain without compromising the immunogenicity of the other strains or the vaccine's tolerability.

  abstract = {Antibody responses to influenza viruses are critical for protection, but the ways in which repeated viral exposures shape antibody evolution and effectiveness over time remain controversial. Early observations demonstrated that the history of viral exposures has a profound effect on the specificity and magnitude of antibody responses to a new viral strain, a phenomenon called ``original antigenic sin.'' Although ``sin'' might suppress some aspects of the immune response, so far there is little indication that hosts with pre-existing immunity are more susceptible to viral infections compared to na\"ive hosts. However, the tendency of the immune response to focus on previously recognized conserved epitopes when encountering new viral strains can create an opportunity cost when mutations arise in these conserved epitopes. Hosts with different exposure histories may continue to experience distinct patterns of infection over time, which may influence influenza viruses' continued antigenic evolution. Understanding the dynamics of B cell competition that underlie the development of antibody responses might help explain the low effectiveness of current influenza vaccines and lead to better vaccination strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recrudescent wave of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 is underway in Mexico in winter 2013-14, following a mild 2012-13 A/H3N2 influenza season. Mexico previously experienced several waves of pandemic A/H1N1 activity in spring, summer and fall 2009 and winter 2011-2012, with a gradual shift of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths towards older ages. Here we describe changes in the epidemiology of the 2013-14 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak, relative to previous seasons dominated by the A/H1N1 pandemic virus. The analysis is intended to guide public health intervention strategies in near real time. METHODS: We analyzed demographic and geographic data on hospitalizations with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza hospitalizations, and inpatient deaths, from a large prospective surveillance system maintained by the Mexican Social Security medical system during 01-October 2013 to 31-Jan 2014. We characterized the age and regional patterns of influenza activity relative to the preceding 2011-2012 A/H1N1 influenza epidemic. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) based on the growth rate of daily case incidence by date of symptoms onset. RESULTS: A total of 7,886 SARI hospitalizations and 529 inpatient-deaths (3.2\%) were reported between 01-October 2013 and 31-January 2014 (resulting in 3.2 laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 hospitalizations per 100,00 and 0.52 laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1-positive deaths per 100,000). The progression of daily SARI hospitalizations in 2013-14 exceeded that observed during the 2011-2012 A/H1N1 epidemic. The mean age of laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 patients in 2013-14 was 41.1 y (SD=20.3) for hospitalizations and 49.2 y (SD=16.7) for deaths. Rates of laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths were significantly higher among individuals aged 30-59 y and lower among younger age groups for the ongoing 2013-2014 epidemic, compared to the 2011-12 A/H1N1 epidemic (Chi-square test, P{$<$}0.001). The reproduction number of the winter 2013-14 wave in central Mexico was estimated at 1.3-1.4 which is slightly higher than that reported for the 2011-2012 A/H1N1 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: We have documented a substantial and ongoing increase in the number of A/H1N1-related hospitalizations and deaths during the period October 2013-January 2014 and a proportionate shift of severe disease to middle aged adults, relative to the preceding A/H1N1 2011-2012 epidemic in Mexico. In the absence of clear antigenic drift in globally circulating A/H1N1 viruses in the post-pandemic period, the gradual change in the age distribution of A/H1N1 infections observed in Mexico suggests a slow build-up of immunity among younger populations, reminiscent of the age profile of past pandemics.},

Methods.{$\quad$} During the 2018\textendash 2019 season, participants were randomized to receive ccIIV4, RIV4, or IIV4 and had serum samples collected prevaccination, 1 and 6 months postvaccination. Serum samples were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) for influenza A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria and microneutralization (MN) for A/H3N2 against cell-grown vaccine reference viruses. Primary outcomes at 1 month were seroconversion rate (SCR), geometric mean titers (GMT), GMT ratio, and mean fold rise (MFR) in the intention-to-treat population. Results.{$\quad$} In total, 727 participants were included (283 ccIIV4, 202 RIV4, and 242 IIV4). At 1 month, responses to ccIIV4 were similar to IIV4 by SCR, GMT, GMT ratio, and MFR. RIV4 induced higher SCRs, GMTs, and MFRs than IIV4 against A/H1N1, A/ H3N2, and B/Yamagata. The GMT ratio of RIV4 to egg-based vaccines was 1.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.2\textendash 1.9) for A/H1N1, 3.0 (95\% CI: 2.4\textendash 3.7) for A/H3N2, 1.1 (95\% CI: .9\textendash 1.4) for B/Yamagata, and 1.1 (95\% CI: .9\textendash 1.3) for B/Victoria. At 6 months, ccIIV4 recipients had similar GMTs to IIV4, whereas RIV4 recipients had higher GMTs against A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata. Conclusions.{$\quad$} RIV4 resulted in improved antibody responses by HI and MN compared to egg-based vaccines against 3 of 4 cellgrown vaccine strains 1 month postvaccination, suggesting a possible additional benefit from RIV4.

We: (i) use computational models to mechanistically dissect how prior immunity influences recall responses; (ii) explore how this affects the rules for evaluating and deploying updated vaccines; and (iii) apply this to SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis of existing data suggests that there is a strong benefit to updating the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to match the currently circulating variants. We propose a general two-dose strategy for determining if vaccines need updating as well as for vaccinating high-risk individuals. Finally, we directly validate our model by reanalysis of earlier human H5N1 influenza vaccine studies.},

Current seasonal influenza vaccines have highly variable efficacy, and thus attempts to develop broadly protective universal influenza vaccines with durable protection are under way. While much attention is given to the virus-related factors contributing to inconsistent vaccine responses, host-associated factors are often neglected. Growing evidences suggest that host factors including age, biological sex, pregnancy, and immune history play important roles as modifiers of influenza virus vaccine efficacy. We hypothesize that host genetics, the hormonal milieu, and gut microbiota contribute to host-related differences in influenza virus vaccine efficacy. This review highlights the current insights and future perspectives into host-specific factors that impact influenza vaccine-induced immunity and protection. Consideration of the host factors that affect influenza vaccine-induced immunity might improve influenza vaccines by providing empirical evidence for optimizing or even personalizing vaccine type, dose, and use of adjuvants for current seasonal and future universal influenza vaccines.},

This study evaluated whether IIV3-HD also improves protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. METHODS: We conducted a phase IIIb-IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial to compare IIV3-HD (60 {$\mu$}g of hemagglutinin per strain) with standard-dose trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD [15 {$\mu$}g of hemagglutinin per strain]) in adults 65 years of age or older. Assessments of relative efficacy, effectiveness, safety (serious adverse events), and immunogenicity (hemagglutination-inhibition [HAI] titers) were performed during the 2011-2012 (year 1) and the 2012-2013 (year 2) northern-hemisphere influenza seasons. RESULTS: A total of 31,989 participants were enrolled from 126 research centers in the United States and Canada (15,991 were randomly assigned to receive IIV3-HD, and 15,998 to receive IIV3-SD). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 228 participants in the IIV3-HD group (1.4\%) and 301 participants in the IIV3-SD group (1.9\%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza caused by any viral type or subtype associated with a protocol-defined influenza-like illness (relative efficacy, 24.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 9.7 to 36.5). At least one serious adverse event during the safety surveillance period was reported by 1323 (8.3\%) of the participants in the IIV3-HD group, as compared with 1442 (9.0\%) of the participants in the IIV3-SD group (relative risk, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 0.99). After vaccination, HAI titers and seroprotection rates (the percentage of participants with HAI titers {$\geq$} 1:40) were significantly higher in the IIV3-HD group. Conclusions: Among persons 65 years of age or older, IIV3-HD induced significantly higher antibody responses and provided better protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness than did IIV3-SD.

  abstract = {Humans are repeatedly exposed to variants of influenza virus throughout their lifetime. As a result, preexisting influenza-specific memory B cells can dominate the response after infection or vaccination. Memory B cells recalled by adulthood exposure are largely reactive to conserved viral epitopes present in childhood strains, posing unclear consequences on the ability of B cells to adapt to and neutralize newly emerged strains. We sought to investigate the impact of preexisting immunity on generation of protective antibody responses to conserved viral epitopes upon influenza virus infection and vaccination in humans. We accomplished this by characterizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from plasmablasts, which are predominantly derived from preexisting memory B cells. We found that, whereas some influenza infection-induced mAbs bound conserved and neutralizing epitopes on the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain or neuraminidase, most of the mAbs elicited by infection targeted non-neutralizing epitopes on nucleoprotein and other unknown antigens. Furthermore, most infection-induced mAbs had equal or stronger affinity to childhood strains, indicating recall of memory B cells from childhood exposures. Vaccination-induced mAbs were similarly induced from past exposures and exhibited substantial breadth of viral binding, although, in contrast to infection-induced mAbs, they targeted neutralizing HA head epitopes. Last, cocktails of infection-induced mAbs displayed reduced protective ability in mice compared to vaccination-induced mAbs. These findings reveal that both preexisting immunity and exposure type shape protective antibody responses to conserved influenza virus epitopes in humans. Natural infection largely recalls cross-reactive memory B cells against non-neutralizing epitopes, whereas vaccination harnesses preexisting immunity to target protective HA epitopes.},

In this study, we used a new computational tool called Neutralization Map to determine the hemagglutination inhibition profiles of individual antibodies within ferret antisera elicited by repeated influenza A/H3 infections. Our results suggest that repeated infections continuously reshape the ferret antibody repertoire, but that a broadly neutralizing antibody signature can nevertheless be induced irrespective of OAS.

Even within individual studies with limited panels, exhaustive testing is not always performed, and there is no common framework for combining information across studies with partially overlapping panels, especially when the assay type or host species differ. Prior studies have demonstrated that antibody-virus interactions can be characterized in a vastly simpler and lower dimensional space, suggesting that relatively few measurements could predict unmeasured antibody-virus interactions. Here, we apply matrix completion to several large-scale influenza and HIV-1 studies. We explore how prediction accuracy evolves as the number of measurements changes and approximates the number of additional measurements necessary in several highly incomplete datasets (suggesting {$\sim$}250,000 measurements could be saved). In addition, we show how the method can combine disparate datasets, even when the number of available measurements is below the theoretical limit that guarantees successful prediction.

In this work, we consider the wealth of antibody inhibition data against variants of the influenza virus. Due to this virus's genetic diversity and evolvability, the variants examined in one study will often have little-to-no overlap with other studies, making it difficult to discern common patterns or unify datasets for further analysis. To that end, we develop a computational framework that predicts how an antibody or serum would inhibit any variant from             any other study             . We use this framework to greatly expand seven influenza datasets utilizing hemagglutination inhibition, validating our method upon 200,000 existing measurements and predicting 2,000,000 new values {$\pm$} uncertainties. With these new values, we quantify the transferability between seven vaccination and infection studies in humans and ferrets, show that the serum potency is negatively correlated with breadth, and present a tool for pandemic preparedness. This data-driven approach does not require any information beyond each virus's name and measurements, and even datasets with as few as 5 viruses can be expanded, making this approach widely applicable. Future influenza studies using hemagglutination inhibition can directly utilize our curated datasets to predict newly measured antibody responses against {$\approx$}80 H3N2 influenza viruses from 1968-2011, whereas immunological studies utilizing other viruses or a different assay only need a single partially-overlapping dataset to extend their work. In essence, this approach enables a shift in perspective when analyzing data from ``what you see is what you get'' into ``what anyone sees is what everyone gets.''},

Often, each measurement only conveys the relationship between a pair of entries, and it is difficult to integrate these local interactions across a dataset to form a cohesive global picture. The classic localization problem tackles this question, transforming local measurements into a global map that reveals the underlying structure of a system. Here, we examine the more challenging bipartite localization problem, where pairwise distances are only available for bipartite data comprising two classes of entries (such as antibody-virus interactions, drug-cell potency, or user-rating profiles). We modify previous algorithms to solve bipartite localization and examine how each method behaves in the presence of noise, outliers, and partially-observed data.

  abstract = {There is a need for improved influenza vaccines. In this study we compared the antibody responses in humans after vaccination with an AS03-adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted H5N1 avian influenza virus inactivated vaccine. Healthy young adults received two doses of either formulation 3 wk apart. We found that AS03 significantly enhanced H5 hemagglutinin (HA)-specific plasmablast and antibody responses compared to the nonadjuvanted vaccine. Plasmablast response after the first immunization was exclusively directed to the conserved HA stem region and came from memory B cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from these plasmablasts had high levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and recognized the HA stem region of multiple influenza virus subtypes. Second immunization induced a plasmablast response to the highly variable HA head region. mAbs derived from these plasmablasts exhibited minimal SHM (naive B cell origin) and largely recognized the HA head region of the immunizing H5N1 strain. Interestingly, the antibody response to H5 HA stem region was much lower after the second immunization, and this suppression was most likely due to blocking of these epitopes by stem-specific antibodies induced by the first immunization. Taken together, these findings show that an adjuvanted influenza vaccine can substantially increase antibody responses in humans by effectively recruiting preexisting memory B cells as well as naive B cells into the response. In addition, we show that high levels of preexisting antibody can have a negative effect on boosting. These findings have implications toward the development of a universal influenza vaccine.},

Infection of mice with 2009 H1N1 induced antibody responses, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell memory responses that were greater in females than males; both sexes, however, were equally protected against secondary challenge with an H1N1 drift variant virus. To test whether greater antibody in females is sufficient for protection against influenza, males and females were immunized with an inactivated H1N1 vaccine that induced predominantly antibody-mediated immunity. Following vaccination, females had greater antibody responses and protection against challenge with an H1N1 drift variant virus than males. Antibody derived from vaccinated females was better at protecting both na\"ive males and females than antibody from males, and this protection was associated with increased antibody specificity and avidity to the H1N1 virus. The expression of Tlr7 was greater in B cells from vaccinated females than males and was associated with reduced DNA methylation in the Tlr7 promoter region, higher neutralizing antibody, class switch recombination, and antibody avidity in females. Deletion of Tlr7 reduced sex differences in vaccine-induced antibody responses and protection following challenge and had a greater impact on responses in females than males. Taken together, these data illustrate that greater TLR7 activation and antibody production in females improves the efficacy of vaccination against influenza.},

With new vaccines such as Shingrix targeting Shingles and Bexsero for Meningitis B, licensed in recent years, today\&rsquo;s population can be protected from more infectious diseases than ever before. Despite this, we are yet to license vaccines for some of the deadliest endemic diseases affecting children, such as malaria. In addition, the threat of epidemics caused by emerging pathogens is very real as exemplified by the 2014\&ndash;2016 Ebola outbreak. Most licensed vaccines provide efficacy through humoral immunity and correlates of protection often quantify neutralising antibody titre. The role of T-cells in vaccine efficacy is less well understood and more complex to quantify. Defining T-cell responses which afford protection also remains a challenge, although more sophisticated assays for assessing cell-mediated immunity with the potential for higher throughput and scalability are now available and warrant review. Here we discuss the benefits of multiparameter cytokine analysis and omics approaches compared with flow cytometric and ELISpot assays. We also review technical challenges unique to clinical trial studies, including assay validation across laboratories and availability of sample type. Measuring T-cell immunogenicity alongside humoral responses provides information on the breadth of immune responses induced by vaccination. Accurately enumerating and phenotyping T-cell immunogenicity to vaccination is key for the determination of immune correlates of protection. However, identifying such T-cell parameters remains challenging without a clear understanding of the immunological mechanisms by which a T-cell-mediated response induces protection.},

Upon infection and vaccination, titers increased broadly, including previously encountered viruses far beyond the extent of cross-reactivity observed after a primary infection. We explored implications for vaccination and found that the use of an antigenically advanced virus had the dual benefit of inducing antibodies against both advanced and previous antigenic clusters.

  abstract = {Evaluation of the antigenic similarity degree between the strains of the influenza virus is highly important for vaccine production. The conventional method used to measure such a degree is related to performing the immunological assays of hemagglutinin inhibition. Namely, the antigenic distance between two strains is calculated on the basis of HI assays. Usually, such distances are visualized by using some kind of antigenic cartography method. The known drawback of the HI assay is that it is rather time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for antigenic distance approximation based on deep learning in the feature spaces induced by hemagglutinin protein sequences and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To apply a CNN to compare the protein sequences, we utilize the encoding based on the physical and chemical characteristics of amino acids. By varying (hyper)parameters of the CNN architecture design, we find the most robust network. Further, we provide insight into the relationship between approximated antigenic distance and antigenicity by evaluating the network on the HI assay database for the H1N1 subtype. The results indicate that the best-trained network gives a high-precision approximation for the ground-truth antigenic distances, and can be used as a good exploratory tool in practical tasks.},

  abstract = {Seasonal influenza is a primary public health burden in the USA and globally. Annual vaccination programs are designed on the basis of circulating influenza viral strains. However, the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine is highly variable between seasons and among individuals. A number of factors are known to influence vaccination effectiveness including age, sex, and comorbidities. Here, we sought to determine whether whole blood gene expression profiling prior to vaccination is informative about pre-existing immunological status and the immunological response to vaccine. We performed whole transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of whole blood samples obtained prior to vaccination from 275 participants enrolled in an annual influenza vaccine trial. Serological status prior to vaccination and 28 days following vaccination was assessed using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) to define baseline immune status and the response to vaccination. We find evidence that genes with immunological functions are increased in expression in individuals with higher pre-existing immunity and in those individuals who mount a greater response to vaccination. Using a random forest model, we find that this set of genes can be used to predict vaccine response with a performance similar to a model that incorporates physiological and prior vaccination status alone. A model using both gene expression and physiological factors has the greatest predictive power demonstrating the potential utility of molecular profiling for enhancing prediction of vaccine response. Moreover, expression of genes that are associated with enhanced vaccination response may point to additional biological pathways that contribute to mounting a robust immunological response to the seasonal influenza vaccine.},

Our results reveal how the strength of virus antagonism, and the time scale over which it acts to thwart the innate immune response, differ significantly between the two viruses, as is made clear by their impact on the temporal behavior of a number of measured genes. The model thus sheds light on the mechanisms that underlie the variability of innate immune responses to different H1N1 viruses.},

In immunosuppressed individuals, CMV can reactivate and cause serious clinical complications, but the effect of the latent state on healthy people remains elusive. We undertook a systems approach to understand the differences between seropositive and negative subjects and measured hundreds of immune system components from blood samples including cytokines and chemokines, immune cell phenotyping, gene expression, ex vivo cell responses to cytokine stimuli, and the antibody response to seasonal influenza vaccination. As expected, we found decreased responses to vaccination and an overall down-regulation of immune components in aged individuals regardless of CMV status. In contrast, CMV-seropositive young adults exhibited enhanced antibody responses to influenza vaccination, increased CD8(+) T cell sensitivity, and elevated levels of circulating interferon-{$\gamma$} compared to seronegative individuals. Experiments with young mice infected with murine CMV also showed significant protection from an influenza virus challenge compared with uninfected animals, although this effect declined with time. These data show that CMV and its murine equivalent can have a beneficial effect on the immune response of young, healthy individuals, which may explain the ubiquity of CMV infection in humans and many other species.},

  abstract = {Sex-specific endocrine and immune responses are widely recognized to account for differential disease outcomes between females and males. Surprisingly, sex-specific risk assessments for influenza, a viral pathogen that affects human populations worldwide through seasonal epidemics and irregular occurring pandemics, are sparse and\textemdash if available\textemdash ambiguous. To date, this precludes proposing an unequivocal sex-dependent susceptibility to influenza. However, one undisputable observation recurrently confirmed during influenza seasons of the last decades is the significantly increased risk for pregnant women. This increased risk is likely attributable to the contradictory demands for the maternal immune system to adapt to pregnancy and to simultaneously mount an immune response to clear the influenza virus infection. Here, we review published evidence on the potential association between sex on influenza risk and propose that future epidemiologic studies should carefully dissect surveillance data for sex-specific effects. Moreover, we propose potential mechanisms involved in enhanced risk for severe influenza during pregnancy that could be studied to identify causal pathways.},

  abstract = {Recent outbreaks of H5, H7, and H9 influenza A viruses in humans have served as a vivid reminder of the potentially devastating effects that a novel pandemic could exert on the modern world. Those who have survived infections with influenza viruses in the past have been protected from subsequent antigenically similar pandemics through adaptive immunity. For example, during the 2009 H1N1 "swine flu" pandemic, those exposed to H1N1 viruses that circulated between 1918 and the 1940s were at a decreased risk for mortality as a result of their previous immunity. It is also generally thought that past exposures to antigenically dissimilar strains of influenza virus may also be beneficial due to cross-reactive cellular immunity. However, cohorts born during prior heterosubtypic pandemics have previously experienced elevated risk of death relative to surrounding cohorts of the same population. Indeed, individuals born during the 1890 H3Nx pandemic experienced the highest levels of excess mortality during the 1918 "Spanish flu." Applying Serfling models to monthly mortality and influenza circulation data between October 1997 and July 2014 in the United States and Mexico, we show corresponding peaks in excess mortality during the 2009 H1N1 "swine flu" pandemic and during the resurgent 2013-2014 H1N1 outbreak for those born at the time of the 1957 H2N2 "Asian flu" pandemic. We suggest that the phenomenon observed in 1918 is not unique and points to exposure to pandemic influenza early in life as a risk factor for mortality during subsequent heterosubtypic pandemics.IMPORTANCE The relatively low mortality experienced by older individuals during the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic has been well documented. However, reported situations in which previous influenza virus exposures have enhanced susceptibility are rare and poorly understood. One such instance occurred in 1918-when those born during the heterosubtypic 1890 H3Nx influenza virus pandemic experienced the highest levels of excess mortality. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon was not unique to the 1918 H1N1 pandemic but that it also occurred during the contemporary 2009 H1N1 pandemic and 2013-2014 H1N1-dominated season for those born during the heterosubtypic 1957 H2N2 "Asian flu" pandemic. These data highlight the heretofore underappreciated phenomenon that, in certain instances, prior exposure to pandemic influenza virus strains can enhance susceptibility during subsequent pandemics. These results have important implications for pandemic risk assessment and should inform laboratory studies aimed at uncovering the mechanism responsible for this effect.},

We did a weighted analysis of the probability of vaccine response (measured as seroconversion and seroprotection) for each vaccine component (H1, H3 and B antigens). Using a multiple regression model, we adjusted for factors that might affect the vaccine response. The adjusted odds-ratio (OR) of responses in elderly versus young adults ranged from 0.24 to 0.59 in terms of seroconversion and seroprotection to all three antigens. The CDC estimates of 70-90\% clinical vaccine efficacy in young adults and these estimates suggest a corresponding clinical efficacy in the elderly of 17-53\% depending on circulating viruses. We conclude that the antibody response in the elderly is considerably lower than in younger adults. This highlights the need for more immunogenic vaccine formulations for the elderly.},

This study examined whether adding a second B-lineage strain affects immunogenicity and safety. Methods This randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of an intradermal quadrivalent split-virion influenza vaccine (IIV4-ID) in adults 18\textendash 64 years of age in the US during the 2012\textendash 2013 influenza season. Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to receive a single injection of IIV4-ID, licensed IIV3-ID, or an investigational IIV3-ID containing the alternate B-lineage strain. Haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres were assessed in two-thirds of participants before vaccination and 28 days after vaccination. Results 1672 participants were vaccinated with IIV4-ID, 837 with licensed IIV3-ID, and 846 with an investigational IIV3-ID. For all four vaccine strains, antibody responses to IIV4-ID were statistically non-inferior to the response to the IIV3-ID vaccines containing the matched strains. For both B strains, post-vaccination antibody responses to IIV4-ID were statistically superior to the responses to IIV3-ID lacking the corresponding B strain. Adverse events were similar for IIV4-ID and IIV3-ID. The most commonly reported solicited reactions were pain, pruritus, myalgia, headache, and malaise; and most were grade 1 or 2 and appeared and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. IIV4-ID was statistically non-inferior to the two pooled IIV3-ID vaccines for the proportions of participants with at least one grade 2 or 3 systemic reaction. Conclusions Antibody responses to the IIV4-ID were non-inferior to IIV3-ID for the A and matched B strains and superior for the unmatched B strains. IIV4-ID was well tolerated without any safety concerns. IIV4-ID may help address an unmet need due to mismatched B strains in previous influenza vaccines.},

Author Summary Influenza viruses of subtype H1N1 and H3N2 both cause seasonal epidemics in humans, but with different age-specific impacts. H3N2 causes a greater proportion of cases in older adults than H1N1, and more deaths overall. People tend to gain the strongest immune memory of influenza viruses encountered in childhood, and so differences in H1N1 and H3N2's age-specific impacts may reflect that individuals born in different eras of influenza circulation have been imprinted with different immunological risk profiles. Another idea is that H3N2 may be more able to infect immunologically experienced adults because it evolves slightly faster than H1N1 and can more quickly escape immune memory. We analyzed a large epidemiological data set and found the clearest signal that birth year-specific differences in childhood immune imprinting, not differences in evolutionary rate, explain differences in H1N1 and H3N2's age-specific impacts. These results can help epidemiologists understand how epidemic risk from specific influenza subtypes is distributed across the population and predict how population risk may shift as differently imprinted birth years grow older. Further, these results provide immunological clues to which facets of immune memory become biased in childhood, and then later play a strong role in protection during seasonal influenza epidemics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The H3N2 component of egg-based 2017-2018 influenza vaccines possessed an adaptive substitution that alters antigenicity. Several influenza vaccines include antigens that are produced through alternative systems, but a systematic comparison of different vaccines used during the 2017-2018 season has not been completed. METHODS: We compared antibody responses in humans vaccinated with Fluzone (egg-based, n = 23), Fluzone High-Dose (egg-based, n = 16), Flublok (recombinant protein-based, n = 23), or Flucelvax (cell-based, n = 23) during the 2017-2018 season. We completed neutralization assays using an egg-adapted H3N2 virus, a cell-based H3N2 virus, wild-type 3c2.A and 3c2.A2 H3N2 viruses, and the H1N1 vaccine strain. We also performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using a recombinant wild-type 3c2.A hemagglutinin. Antibody responses were compared in adjusted analysis. RESULTS: Postvaccination neutralizing antibody titers to 3c2.A and 3c2.A2 were higher in Flublok recipients compared with Flucelvax or Fluzone recipients (P {$<$} .01). Postvaccination titers to 3c2.A and 3c2.A2 were similar in Flublok and Fluzone High-Dose recipients, though seroconversion rates trended higher in Flublok recipients. Postvaccination titers in Flucelvax recipients were low to all H3N2 viruses tested, including the cell-based H3N2 strain. Postvaccination neutralizing antibody titers to H1N1 were similar among the different vaccine groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that influenza vaccine antigen match and dose are both important for eliciting optimal H3N2 antibody responses in humans. Future studies should be designed to determine if our findings directly impact vaccine effectiveness. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT03068949.},

  abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) strains are denoted by the subtype of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) virion surface proteins. Major changes in HA subtype among strains circulating in humans are referred to as ``antigenic shift''. Antigenic shift can occur by two means; direct transmission of a zoonotic strain to humans or through reshuffling of the segmented genome in cells co-infected with animal and human strains. The lack of circulating anti-HA antibodies in human populations to a novel IAV results in extremely high frequency of illness and the potential for severe morbidity and mortality on a world-wide basis; the dreaded pandemic. Such pandemics could be partially controlled by developing a vaccine that generates effective heterosubtypic immunity (HSI) based on immune recognition of IAV antigens conserved across all viral strains. While it has long been known that T cells exhibit such broad cross-reactive specificity that could provide effective HSI, recent animal studies suggest a potential role for antibodies as well. Here we review current knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to HSI to influenza and speculate on the potential for this approach to contribute to public health.},

Recently, we have also demonstrated that over a wide range of intermediate levels of immune selection, pathogens may still be structured into discrete strains, but different sets of non-overlapping pathogen types will replace each other in a cyclical or chaotic manner. These models assume that the ranking of antigens in terms of the strength of the induced immune response is the same for every host. However, host immune responses may be restricted by the genotype of the individual. To explore this issue, a mathematical model was constructed under the assumption that a proportion of the host population responds principally to a variable antigen while the remainder of the population responds principally to a conserved antigen. The results of this analysis indicate that discrete strain structure (DSS) will be maintained even with a high frequency of hosts that do not respond in a variant-specific manner. Furthermore, the range of the immune selection pressure over which DSS prevails is increased (and the region of cyclical or chaotic behaviour reduced) by the inclusion of hosts that respond in a cross-reactive rather than a variant-specific manner.},

Accumulating evidence shows the first viruses an individual is exposed to leaves an imprint on the antibody response induced by subsequent drifted and novel influenza viral exposures. Imprinted humoral immunity against influenza viruses relies on biased immune memory to influenza viruses for which memory B cell responses were initially generated against. Imprinting allows for antibodies to adapt to drifted influenza viruses while maintaining binding potential for the first influenza viruses an individual is exposed to. However, imprinting can increase susceptibility to non-imprinted influenza viruses and mismatched influenza viruses. This review highlights the role of imprinting on the regulation of antibody responses induced by influenza viruses and explores potential vaccine strategies to harness imprinted antibody responses to increase protection against influenza.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A new pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has emerged, causing illness globally, primarily in younger age groups. To assess the level of preexisting immunity in humans and to evaluate seasonal vaccine strategies, we measured the antibody response to the pandemic virus resulting from previous influenza infection or vaccination in different age groups. METHODS: Using a microneutralization assay, we measured cross-reactive antibodies to pandemic H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) in stored serum samples from persons who either donated blood or were vaccinated with recent seasonal or 1976 swine influenza vaccines. RESULTS: A total of 4 of 107 persons (4\%) who were born after 1980 had preexisting cross-reactive antibody titers of 40 or more against 2009 H1N1, whereas 39 of 115 persons (34\%) born before 1950 had titers of 80 or more. Vaccination with seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines resulted in an increase in the level of cross-reactive antibody to 2009 H1N1 by a factor of four or more in none of 55 children between the ages of 6 months and 9 years, in 12 to 22\% of 231 adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years, and in 5\% or less of 113 adults 60 years of age or older. Seasonal vaccines that were formulated with adjuvant did not further enhance cross-reactive antibody responses. Vaccination with the A/New Jersey/1976 swine influenza vaccine substantially boosted cross-reactive antibodies to 2009 H1N1 in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with recent seasonal nonadjuvanted or adjuvanted influenza vaccines induced little or no cross-reactive antibody response to 2009 H1N1 in any age group. Persons under the age of 30 years had little evidence of cross-reactive antibodies to the pandemic virus. However, a proportion of older adults had preexisting cross-reactive antibodies.},

  abstract = {The strength and breadth of an individual's antibody repertoire is an important predictor of their response to influenza infection or vaccination. Although progress has been made in understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), A/H3N2 priming inoculation and post-vaccination A/H1N1 inoculation. We fit models with various immunological mechanisms that have been empirically observed but have not previously been included in mathematical models of antibody landscapes, including: titre ceiling effects, antigenic seniority and exposure-type specific cross reactivity. Based on the parameter estimates of the best supported models, we describe a number of key immunological features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2 improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody boosting than the first. Either antigenic seniority or a titre ceiling effect were included in the two best fitting models, suggesting a role for a mechanism describing diminishing antibody boosting with repeated exposures. Although there was considerable uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our results suggest that both short and long term waning were present and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics of influenza., Despite most individuals having some preexisting immunity from past influenza infections and vaccinations, a significant proportion of the human population is infected with influenza each year. Predicting how an individual's antibody profile will change following exposure is therefore useful for evaluating which populations are at greatest risk and how effective vaccination strategies might be. However, interpretation of antibody data from humans is complicated by immunological interactions between all previous, unobserved exposures in an individual's life. We developed a mathematical model to describe short-term antibody kinetics that are important in building an individual's immune profile but are difficult to observe in human populations. We validated this model using antibody data from ferrets with known, varied infection and vaccination histories. We were able to quantify the independent contributions of various exposures and immunological mechanisms in generating observed antibody titres. These results suggest that data from experimental systems may be included in models of human antibody dynamics, which may improve predictions of vaccination strategy effectiveness and how population susceptibility changes over time.},

Within individual vaccine response patterns, a common subset of 742 genes was strongly correlated with migrating plasma cells. Of these, 366 genes were associated with human plasmablasts differentiating in vitro. Additionally, subject-specific temporal transcriptome patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells identified migration of myeloid/dendritic cell lineage cells one day after vaccination. Upstream analyses of transcriptome changes suggested both shared and subject-specific transcription groups underlying larger patterns.

Antibodies induced by vaccination are an important mechanism of protection against infection. Despite the overall public health success of influenza vaccination, many individuals fail to induce a substantial antibody response. Systems-level immune profiling studies have discerned associations between transcriptional and cell subset signatures with the success of antibody responses. However, existing signatures have relied on small cohorts and have not been validated in large independent studies. We leveraged multiple influenza vaccination cohorts spanning distinct geographical locations and seasons from the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) and the Center for Human Immunology (CHI) to identify baseline (i.e., before vaccination) predictive transcriptional signatures of influenza vaccination responses. Our multicohort analysis of HIPC data identified nine genes (RAB24, GRB2, DPP3, ACTB, MVP, DPP7, ARPC4, PLEKHB2, and ARRB1) and three gene modules that were significantly associated with the magnitude of the antibody response, and these associations were validated in the independent CHI cohort. These signatures were specific to young individuals, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie the lower vaccine response in older individuals. We found an inverse correlation between the effect size of signatures in young and older individuals. Although the presence of an inflammatory gene signature, for example, was associated with better antibody responses in young individuals, it was associated with worse responses in older individuals. These results point to the prospect of predicting antibody responses before vaccination and provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying successful vaccination responses.},

  abstract = {With the rising prevalence of obesity has come an increasing awareness of its impact on communicable disease. As a consequence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic, obesity was identified for the first time as a risk factor for increased disease severity and mortality in infected individuals. Over-nutrition that results in obesity causes a chronic state of meta-inflammation with systemic implications for immunity. Obese hosts exhibit delayed and blunted antiviral responses to influenza virus infection, and they experience poor recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the efficacy of antivirals and vaccines is reduced in this population and obesity may also play a role in altering the viral life cycle, thus complementing the already weakened immune response and leading to severe pathogenesis. Case studies and basic research in human cohorts and animal models have highlighted the prolonged viral shed in the obese host, as well as a microenvironment that permits the emergence of virulent minor variants. This review focuses on influenza A virus pathogenesis in the obese host, and on the impact of obesity on the antiviral response, viral shed, and viral evolution. We comprehensively analyze the recent literature on how and why viral pathogenesis is altered in the obese host along with the impact of the altered host and pathogenic state on viral evolutionary dynamics in multiple models. Finally, we summarized the effectiveness of current vaccines and antivirals in this populations and the questions that remain to be answered. If current trends continue, nearly 50\% of the worldwide population is projected to be obese by 2050. This population will have a growing impact on both non-communicable and communicable diseases and may affect global evolutionary trends of influenza virus.},

Healthy subjects 50 to 74 years old received the 2010-2011 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. We measured venous samples from Days 0, 28, and 75 for HI and VNA and B-cell ELISPOTs. Of 106 subjects, HI titers demonstrated a ceiling effect for 11 or 10\% for those with a pre-vaccination HI titer of 1:640 where no subject post-vaccination had an increase in titer. Of the remaining 95 subjects, only 37 or 35\% overall had at least a 4-fold increase by Day 28. Of these 37, 3 waned at least 4-fold, and 13 others 2-fold. Thus 15\% of the subjects showed waning antibody titers by Day 75. More than half failed to respond at all. The profiles populated by these subjects as defined by HI did not vary with age or gender. The VNA results mimicked the HI profiles, but the profiles for B-cell ELISPOT did not. HI titers at Days 0, 28, and 75 populate 4 biologically plausible profiles. Limitations include lack of consensus for operationally defining waning as well as for the apparent ceiling. Furthermore, though well accepted as a marker for vaccine response, assigning thresholds with HI has limitations. However, VNA closely matches HI in populating these profiles. Thus, we hold that these profiles, having face- and content-validity, may provide a basis for understanding variation in genomic and transcriptomic response to influenza vaccination in this age group.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antigenic differences of major H7 strains with an ultimate aim to discover H7 HA proteins that can elicit protective receptor-binding antibodies against co-circulating H7 influenza strains. METHOD: A panel of eight H7 influenza strains were selected from 3,633 H7 HA amino acid sequences identified over the past two decades (2000-2018). The sequences were expressed on the surface of virus like particles (VLPs) and used to vaccinate C57BL/6 mice. Serum samples were collected and tested for hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity. The vaccinated mice were challenged with lethal dose of H7N9 virus, A/Anhui/1/2013. RESULTS: VLPs expressing the H7 HA antigens elicited broadly reactive antibodies each of the selected H7 HAs, except the A/Turkey/Italy/589/2000 (Italy/00) H7 HA. A putative glycosylation due to an A169T substitution in antigenic site B was identified as a unique antigenic profile of Italy/00. Introduction of the putative glycosylation site (H7 HA-A169T) significantly altered the antigenic profile of HA of the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain. CONCLUSION: This study identified key amino acid mutations that result in severe vaccine mismatches for future H7 epidemics. Future universal influenza vaccine candidates will need to focus on viral variants with these key mutations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Current inactivated influenza vaccines provide suboptimal protection against antigenic drift, and repeated annual vaccinations shape antibody specificity but the effect on protection from infection is not well understood. METHODS: We studied the effects of cumulative and staggered vaccinations in mice to determine the effect of influenza vaccination on protection from infection and immune quality. RESULTS: We found that the timing of vaccination and antigenic change impacted the quality of immune responses. When mice received two different H3N2 strains (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 and A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016) by staggered timing of vaccination, there were higher H3HA antibody and B-cell memory responses than four cumulative vaccinations or when two vaccinations were successive. Interestingly, after challenge with a lethal-drifted H3N2 virus (A/Hong Kong/1/1968), mice with staggered vaccination were unable to produce high titres of antibodies specific to the challenge strain compared to other vaccination regimens because of high levels of vaccine-specific cross-reactive antibodies. All vaccination regimens resulted in protection, in terms of viral loads and survival, from lethal challenge, while lung IL-6 and inflammation were lowest in staggered or cumulative vaccination groups, indicating further advantage. CONCLUSION: Our findings help justify influenza vaccination policies that currently recommend repeat vaccination in infants and annual seasonal vaccination, with no evidence for impaired immunity by repeated seasonal vaccination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The loss of half the U.S. supply of influenza vaccine due to contamination has created a critical shortage. Dose-sparing strategies that use intradermal delivery of vaccines may be one approach to consider. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label trial outside the influenza season in 100 healthy adults 18 to 40 years of age to compare the immunogenicity and safety of intradermal immunization with influenza vaccine with standard intramuscular immunization. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a single intramuscular dose of 0.5 ml of trivalent influenza vaccine, containing at least 15 microg of hemagglutinin per strain, by means of a prefilled syringe or a single intradermal dose of 0.1 ml, containing at least 3 microg of hemagglutinin per strain, by means of a fine-gauge needle; both injections were in the deltoid region. Changes in the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody titer were assessed by comparing geometric mean titers and fold increases relative to baseline values and by comparing changes in the seroconversion and seroprotection rates. Local and systemic adverse events were assessed after both types of vaccination. RESULTS: Subjects who received an intradermal injection with one fifth the standard dose of influenza vaccine had increases in the geometric mean HAI titer by a factor of 15.2 for the H1N1 strain in the vaccine, 19.0 for the H3N2 strain, and 12.4 for the B strain on day 21, as compared with respective increases by a factor of 14.9, 7.1, and 15.3 for the intramuscular injection of the standard dose. Seroconversion and seroprotection rates were similar in the two groups on day 21, ranging from 66 to 82 percent and 84 to 100 percent, respectively. Local reactions were significantly more frequent among recipients of intradermal injections than among recipients of intramuscular injections, but such reactions were mild and transient. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of young adults, intradermal administration of one fifth the standard intramuscular dose of an influenza vaccine elicited immunogenicity that was similar to or better than that elicited by intramuscular injection. Intradermal administration could be used to expand the supplies of influenza vaccine, but further studies are needed before this strategy can be recommended for routine use.},

  abstract = {Numerous modern technological and scientific advances have changed the vaccine industry. However, nearly 70 years of influenza vaccine usage have passed without substantial changes in the underlying principles of the vaccine. The challenge of vaccinating against influenza lies in the constantly changing nature of the virus itself. Influenza viruses undergo antigenic evolution through antigenic drift and shift in their surface glycoproteins. This has forced frequent updates of vaccine antigens to ensure that the somewhat narrowly focused vaccine-induced immune responses defend against circulating strains. Few vaccine production systems have been developed that can entertain such constant changes. Although influenza virus infection induces long-lived immunologic memory to the same or similar strains, most people do not encounter the same strain repeatedly in their lifespan, suggesting that enhancement of natural immunity is required to improve influenza vaccines. It is clear that transformative change of influenza vaccines requires a rethink of how we immunize. In this study, we review the problems associated with the changing nature of the virus, and highlight some of the approaches being employed to improve influenza vaccines.},

We stratified VE by usual age groups (0-14, 15-64, {$\geq$}\,65-years). To assess the imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV) hypothesis, we further stratified the middle-aged group, notably including 32-54-year-olds (1964-86) sharing potential childhood imprinting to serine at haemagglutinin position 159.ResultsInfluenza A(H3N2) VE among all ages was -1\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): -24 to 18) and 46\% (95\% CI: 8-68), -26\% (95\% CI: -66 to 4) and 20\% (95\% CI: -20 to 46) among 0-14, 15-64 and {$\geq$}\,65-year-olds, respectively. Among 15-64-year-olds, VE against clades 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a was 15\% (95\% CI: -34 to 50) and -74\% (95\% CI: -259 to 16), respectively. VE was -18\% (95\% CI: -140 to 41), -53\% (95\% CI: -131 to -2) and -12\% (95\% CI: -74 to 28) among 15-31-year-olds (1987-2003), 32-54-year-olds (1964-86) and 55-64-year-olds (1954-63), respectively.DiscussionThe lowest 2018/19 influenza A(H3N2) VE was against clade 3C.3a and among those born 1964-86, corresponding to the I-REV hypothesis. The low influenza A(H3N2) VE in 15-64-year-olds and the public health impact of the I-REV hypothesis warrant further study.},

Certain immunological sex differences are present throughout life, whereas others are only apparent after puberty and before reproductive senescence, suggesting that both genes and hormones are involved. Furthermore, early environmental exposures influence the microbiome and have sex-dependent effects on immune function. Importantly, these sex-based immunological differences contribute to variations in the incidence of autoimmune diseases and malignancies, susceptibility to infectious diseases and responses to vaccines in males and females. Here, we discuss these differences and emphasize that sex is a biological variable that should be considered in immunological studies.},

  abstract = {Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that, in humans, is caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in \textasciitilde 1 billion infections, 3\textendash 5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000\textendash 500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in\,{$>$}40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.},

Immune responses to natural infection with influenza virus in humans are relatively broad and long-lived, but influenza viruses can escape from these responses over time owing to their high mutation rates and antigenic flexibility. Vaccines are the best available countermeasure against infection, but vaccine effectiveness is low compared with other viral vaccines, and the induced immune response is narrow and short-lived. Furthermore, inactivated influenza virus vaccines focus on the~induction of systemic IgG responses but do not effectively induce mucosal IgA responses. Here, I review the differences between natural infection and vaccination in terms of the antibody responses they induce and how these responses protect against future infection. A better understanding of how natural infection induces broad and long-lived immune responses will be key to developing next-generation influenza virus vaccines.},

However, the development of an individual's long-lived antibody response to influenza A over the course of a lifetime remains poorly understood. Accurately describing this immunological process requires a fundamental understanding of how the mechanisms of boosting and cross-reactivity respond to repeated infections. Establishing the contribution of such mechanisms to antibody titres remains challenging because the aggregate effect of immune responses over a lifetime are rarely observed directly. To uncover the aggregate effect of multiple influenza infections, we developed a mechanistic model capturing both past infections and subsequent antibody responses. We estimated parameters of the model using cross-sectional antibody titres to nine different strains spanning 40 years of circulation of influenza A(H3N2) in southern China. We found that ``antigenic seniority'' and quickly decaying cross-reactivity were important components of the immune response, suggesting that the order in which individuals were infected with influenza strains shaped observed neutralisation titres to a particular virus. We also obtained estimates of the frequency and age distribution of influenza infection, which indicate that although infections became less frequent as individuals progressed through childhood and young adulthood, they occurred at similar rates for individuals above age 30 y. By establishing what are likely to be important mechanisms driving epochal trends in population immunity, we also identified key directions for future studies. In particular, our results highlight the need for longitudinal samples that are tested against multiple historical strains. This could lead to a better understanding of how, over the course of a lifetime, fast, transient antibody dynamics combine with the longer-term immune responses considered here., A combination of cross-sectional serological data from Southern China and mathematical modeling reveals key aspects of the human immune system's response to seasonal influenza infection., Host immunity against seasonal influenza viruses influences the emergence of new virus strains, the size and severity of ``flu'' epidemics, and the effectiveness of vaccination programmes. However, the specific factors that shape the immune response of a single human to a particular strain are little understood because individual infections and the development of immunity over a lifetime in that person are rarely observed directly. To determine the aggregate effect of a lifetime of influenza infections on host immunity, we developed a mathematical model that captures the specific strains with which an individual has been infected and for the corresponding antibody response, the relative contribution of boosting, cross-reactivity, and antigenic seniority to its neutralising ability. Combining the model with data from a survey in southern China that examined antibody levels against nine different influenza strains from 1968 to 2009, we revealed key components of the immune response to influenza virus infection, and obtained estimates of the frequency of influenza infection and the ages at which infection occurred. Our results suggest that ``antigenic seniority'', whereby strains encountered earlier in life gain more ``senior'' positions in the immune response, and short-lived cross-reactivity between different strains are important components of the immune response and, therefore, could shape the evolution and emergence of influenza viruses.},

These infections, which include dengue virus, influenza and malaria, generate substantial morbidity and mortality. However, there are considerable theoretical challenges involved in modelling such infections. As well as describing the interaction between strains that occurs as a result cross-immunity and evolution, models must balance biological realism with mathematical and computational tractability. Here we review different modelling approaches, and suggest a number of biological problems that are potential candidates for study with these methods. We provide a comprehensive outline of the benefits and disadvantages of available frameworks, and describe what biological information is preserved and lost under different modelling assumptions. We also consider the emergence of new disease strains, and discuss how models of pathogens with multiple strains could be developed further in future. This includes extending the flexibility and biological realism of current approaches, as well as interface with data.},

Because individuals are infected with multiple influenza strains during their lifetime and each virus can generate a cross-reactive antibody response, it is challenging to quantify the processes that shape observed immune responses, or to reliably detect recent infection from serological samples. Using a Bayesian model of antibody dynamics at multiple timescales, we explain complex cross-reactive antibody landscapes by inferring participants' histories of infection with serological data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of influenza A/H3N2 in southern China and Vietnam. We show an individual's influenza antibody profile can be explained by a short-lived, broadly cross-reactive response that decays within a year to leave a smaller long-term response acting against a narrower range of strains. We also demonstrate that accounting for dynamic immune responses can provide a more accurate alternative to traditional definitions seroconversion for the estimation of infection attack rates. Our work provides a general model for explaining mechanisms of influenza immunity acting at multiple timescales based on contemporary serological data, and suggests a two-armed immune response to influenza infection consistent with competitive dynamics between B cell populations.

  abstract = {The cellular immune response to primary influenza virus infection is complex, involving multiple cell types and anatomical compartments, and is difficult to measure directly. Here we develop a two-compartment model that quantifies the interplay between viral replication and adaptive immunity. The fidelity of the model is demonstrated by accurately confirming the role of CD4 help for antibody persistence and the consequences of immune depletion experiments. The model predicts that drugs to limit viral infection and/or production must be administered within 2 days of infection, with a benefit of combination therapy when administered early, and cytotoxic CD8 T cells in the lung are as effective for viral clearance as neutralizing antibodies when present at the time of challenge. The model can be used to investigate explicit biological scenarios and generate experimentally testable hypotheses. For example, when the adaptive response depends on cellular immune cell priming, regulation of antigen presentation has greater influence on the kinetics of viral clearance than the efficiency of virus neutralization or cellular cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the modulation of antigen presentation or the number of lung resident cytotoxic cells and the combination drug intervention are strategies to combat highly virulent influenza viruses. We further compared alternative model structures, for example, B-cell activation directly by the virus versus that through professional antigen-presenting cells or dendritic cell licensing of CD8 T cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza is responsible for a significant disease burden annually, especially in older adults. This study reviews the relative vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD-IIV3) in adults {$\geq$}65 against influenza-associated outcomes to inform evidence-based decision-making to shift clinical practice and standard of care in this population. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted for studies assessing the rVE of HD-IIV3 against probable/laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions, and death in adults {$\geq$}65. Results from individual seasons were meta-analyzed and a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled rVEs. RESULTS: After screening 992 studies, seven studies were meta-analyzed. HD-IIV3 demonstrated better protection against ILI compared to SD-IIV3 (rVE~=~19.5\%; 95\% CI: 8.6-29.0\%). HD-IIV3 was also more effective at preventing hospital admissions from all-causes (rVE~=~9.1\%; 95\% CI: 2.4-15.3\%), as well as from influenza (rVE~=~17.8\%; 95\% CI: 8.1-26.5\%), pneumonia (rVE~=~24.3\%, 95\% CI: 13.9-33.4\%), and cardiorespiratory events (rVE~=~18.2\%; 95\% CI: 6.8-28.1\%). rVE against post-influenza mortality was 22.2\% (95\% CI: -18.2-48.8\%) and 2.5\% (95\% CI: -5.2-9.5\%) against all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests HD-IIV3 is more effective than SD-IIV3 at reducing the clinical outcomes associated with influenza infection in older adults and should be considered for routine use in the 65+ population.},

  abstract = {A longstanding question is how influenza evolves to escape human immunity, which is polyclonal and can target many distinct epitopes on the virus. Here we map how all amino-acid mutations to influenza's major surface protein affect viral neutralization by polyclonal human sera. The serum of some individuals is so focused that it selects single mutations that reduce viral neutralization by over an order of magnitude. However, different viral mutations escape the sera of different individuals. This individual-to-individual variation in viral escape mutations is not present among ferrets, which are frequently used as a model in influenza studies. Our results show how different single mutations help influenza escape the immunity of different members of the human population, a phenomenon that could shape viral evolution and disease susceptibility.},

The continued evolution of the A(H7N9) viruses poses major challenges in pandemic preparedness strategies through vaccination. We assessed the breadth of the heterologous neutralizing antibody responses against the 3rd and 5th wave A(H7N9) viruses using the 1st wave vaccine sera from 4 vaccine groups: 1. inactivated vaccine with 2.8 \textmu g hemagglutinin (HA)/dose + AS03A; 2. inactivated vaccine with 5.75 \textmu g HA/dose + AS03A; 3. inactivated vaccine with 11.5 \textmu g HA/dose + MF59; and 4. recombinant virus like particle (VLP) vaccine with 15 \textmu g HA/dose + ISCOMATRIX\texttrademark. Vaccine group 1 had the highest antibody responses to the vaccine virus and the 3rd/5th wave drifted viruses. Notably, the relative levels of cross-reactivity to the drifted viruses as measured by the antibody GMT ratios to the 5th wave viruses were similar across all 4 vaccine groups. The 1st wave vaccines induced robust responses to the 3rd and Pearl River Delta lineage 5th wave viruses but lower cross-reactivity to the highly pathogenic 5th wave A(H7N9) virus. The population in the United States was largely immunologically naive to the A(H7N9) HA. Seasonal vaccination induced cross-reactive neuraminidase inhibition and binding antibodies to N9, but minimal cross-reactive antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies to A(H7N9).},

Seasonal influenza vaccines also stand out for their variable effectiveness by age group from year to year and by recent vaccination status. These patterns suggest a role for immune history in influenza vaccine effectiveness, but inference is complicated by uncertainty about the contributions of bias to the estimates themselves. In this review, we describe unexpected patterns in the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination and explain how these patterns might arise as consequences of study design, the dynamics of immune memory, or both. Resolving this uncertainty could lead to improvements in vaccination strategy, including the use of universal vaccines in experienced populations, and the evaluation of vaccine efficacy against influenza and other antigenically variable pathogens.},

All vaccines induced comparable H3-HA-specific IgG and elevated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity at day 30 post vaccination. H3-HA-specific ADCC responses were greatest following H-eIIV. Only A-eIIV increased H3-HA-IgG avidity, HA-stalk IgG and ADCC activity. eIIVs also increased polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, while cellular immune responses were skewed toward single-cytokine-producing T cells among S-IIV subjects. Our study provides further immunological evidence for the preferential use of eIIVs in older adults as each vaccine platform had an advantage over the standard-dose vaccine in terms of NK cell activation, HA-stalk antibodies, and T cell responses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate estimation of the influenza death burden is of great significance for influenza prevention and control. However, few studies have considered the short-term harvesting effects of influenza on mortality when estimating influenza-associated excess deaths by cause of death, age, sex, and subtype/lineage. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the cause-, age-, and sex-specific excess mortality associated with influenza and its subtypes and lineages in Guangzhou from 2015 to 2018. METHODS: Distributed-lag nonlinear models were fitted to estimate the excess mortality related to influenza subtypes or lineages for different causes of death, age groups, and sex based on daily time-series data for mortality, influenza, and meteorological factors. RESULTS: A total of 199,777 death certificates were included in the study. The average annual influenza-associated excess mortality rate (EMR) was 25.06 (95\% empirical CI [eCI] 19.85-30.16) per 100,000 persons; 7142 of 8791 (81.2\%) deaths were due to respiratory or cardiovascular mortality (EMR 20.36, 95\% eCI 16.75-23.74). Excess respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in people aged 60 to 79 years and those aged {$\geq$}80 years accounted for 32.9\% (2346/7142) and 63.7\% (4549/7142) of deaths, respectively. The male to female ratio (MFR) of excess death from respiratory diseases was 1.34 (95\% CI 1.17-1.54), while the MFR for excess death from cardiovascular disease was 0.72 (95\% CI 0.63-0.82). The average annual excess respiratory and cardiovascular mortality rates attributed to influenza A (H3N2), B/Yamagata, B/Victoria, and A (H1N1) were 8.47 (95\% eCI 6.60-10.30), 5.81 (95\% eCI 3.35-8.25), 3.68 (95\% eCI 0.81-6.49), and 2.83 (95\% eCI -1.26 to 6.71), respectively. Among these influenza subtypes/lineages, A (H3N2) had the highest excess respiratory and cardiovascular mortality rates for people aged 60 to 79 years (20.22, 95\% eCI 14.56-25.63) and {$\geq$}80 years (180.15, 95\% eCI 130.75-227.38), while younger people were more affected by A (H1N1), with an EMR of 1.29 (95\% eCI 0.07-2.32). The mortality displacement of influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B/Yamagata was 2 to 5 days, but 5 to 13 days for B/Victoria. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza was associated with substantial mortality in Guangzhou, occurring predominantly in the elderly, even after considering mortality displacement. The mortality burden of influenza B, particularly B/Yamagata, cannot be ignored. Contrasting sex differences were found in influenza-associated excess mortality from respiratory diseases and from cardiovascular diseases; the underlying mechanisms need to be investigated in future studies. Our findings can help us better understand the magnitude and time-course of the effect of influenza on mortality and inform targeted interventions for mitigating the influenza mortality burden, such as immunizations with quadrivalent vaccines (especially for older people), behavioral campaigns, and treatment strategies.},

Immune markers that could predict individual protection against infection and disease, commonly called correlates of protection (CoPs), play an important role in vaccine development and licensing. Here, we discuss the epidemiologic considerations when evaluating immune markers as potential CoPs for influenza vaccines and emphasize the distinction between correlation and causation. While an immune marker that correlates well with protection from infection can be used as a predictor of vaccine efficacy, it should be distinguished from an immune marker that plays a mechanistic role in conferring protection against a clinical endpoint\textemdash the latter might be a more reliable predictor of vaccine efficacy and a more appropriate target for rational vaccine design. To clearly distinguish mechanistic and nonmechanistic CoPs, we suggest using the term ``correlates of protection'' for nonmechanistic CoPs, and ``mediators of protection'' for mechanistic CoPs. Furthermore, because the interactions among and relative importance of correlates or mediators of protection can vary according to age or prior vaccine experience, the effect sizes and thresholds for protective effects for CoPs could also vary in different segments of the population.},

However, H1N1 viruses disproportionately affected middle-aged adults during the 2013-2014 influenza season. Although H1N1 viruses recently acquired several mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, classic serological tests used by surveillance laboratories indicate that these mutations do not change antigenic properties of the virus. Here, we show that one of these mutations is located in a region of HA targeted by antibodies elicited in many middle-aged adults. We find that over 42\% of individuals born between 1965 and 1979 possess antibodies that recognize this region of HA. Our findings offer a possible antigenic explanation of why middle-aged adults were highly susceptible to H1N1 viruses during the 2013-2014 influenza season. Our data further suggest that a drifted H1N1 strain should be included in future influenza vaccines to potentially reduce morbidity and mortality in this age group.},

This phenomena is called 'original antigenic sin' (OAS) since this can occur at the expense of generating new de novo Abs. Here, we characterized the specificity and functionality of Abs elicited in mice that were sequentially exposed to two antigenically distinct H1N1 influenza virus strains. Many Abs elicited under these conditions had an OAS phenotype, in that they bound strongly to the viral strain used for the first exposure and very weakly to the viral strain used for the second exposure. We found that OAS and non-OAS Abs target the same general region of the influenza hemagglutinin protein and that B cells expressing these two types of Abs can be clonally-related. Surprisingly, although OAS Abs bound with very low affinities, some were able to effectively protect against an antigenically drifted viral strain following passive transfer in vivo. Taken together, our data indicate that OAS Abs share some level of cross-reactivity between priming and recall viral strains and that B cells producing these Abs can be protective when recalled into secondary immune responses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex. METHODS: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95\% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95\% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. FINDINGS: In 2010, there were 52{$\cdot$}8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24{$\cdot$}9\% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15{$\cdot$}9 million (34{$\cdot$}1\%) of 46{$\cdot$}5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2{$\cdot$}5 to 1{$\cdot$}4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3{$\cdot$}4 to 2{$\cdot$}8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3{$\cdot$}1 to 2{$\cdot$}2 million), measles (from 0{$\cdot$}63 to 0{$\cdot$}13 million), and tetanus (from 0{$\cdot$}27 to 0{$\cdot$}06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0{$\cdot$}30 million in 1990 to 1{$\cdot$}5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1{$\cdot$}7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19{$\cdot$}9\% since 1990 to 1{$\cdot$}17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1{$\cdot$}2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34{$\cdot$}5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38\% more than two decades ago; of these, 1{$\cdot$}5 million (19\%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12{$\cdot$}9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1{$\cdot$}3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5{$\cdot$}1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9{$\cdot$}6\%) compared with two decades earlier (8{$\cdot$}8\%). This was driven by a 46\% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1{$\cdot$}3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54\% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28\%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76\% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. INTERPRETATION: Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {Current influenza virus vaccines contain H1N1 (phylogenetic group 1 hemagglutinin), H3N2 (phylogenetic group 2 hemagglutinin), and influenza B virus components. These vaccines induce good protection against closely matched strains by predominantly eliciting antibodies against the membrane distal globular head domain of their respective viral hemagglutinins. This domain, however, undergoes rapid antigenic drift, allowing the virus to escape neutralizing antibody responses. The membrane proximal stalk domain of the hemagglutinin is much more conserved compared to the head domain. In recent years, a growing collection of antibodies that neutralize a broad range of influenza virus strains and subtypes by binding to this domain has been isolated. Here, we demonstrate that a vaccination strategy based on the stalk domain of the H3 hemagglutinin (group 2) induces in mice broadly neutralizing anti-stalk antibodies that are highly cross-reactive to heterologous H3, H10, H14, H15, and H7 (derived from the novel Chinese H7N9 virus) hemagglutinins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these antibodies confer broad protection against influenza viruses expressing various group 2 hemagglutinins, including an H7 subtype. Through passive transfer experiments, we show that the protection is mediated mainly by neutralizing antibodies against the stalk domain. Our data suggest that, in mice, a vaccine strategy based on the hemagglutinin stalk domain can protect against viruses expressing divergent group 2 hemagglutinins.},

  abstract = {Some studies have reported negative effects of prior-season influenza vaccination. Prior-season influenza vaccination effects on vaccine effectiveness (VE) in children are not well understood.To assess the association of prior-season influenza vaccination with subsequent VE in children aged 2 to 17 years.This multiseason, test-negative case-control study was conducted in outpatient clinics at 4 US sites among children aged 2 to 17 years with a medically attended febrile acute respiratory illness. Participants were recruited during the 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 seasons when influenza circulated locally. Cases were children with influenza confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Test-negative control individuals were children with negative test results for influenza.Vaccination history, including influenza vaccine type received in the enrollment season (live attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV], inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV], or no vaccine) and season before enrollment (LAIV, IIV, or no vaccine), determined from medical records and immunization registries.LAIV and IIV effectiveness by influenza type and subtype (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09, influenza A[H3N2], or influenza B), estimated as 100\,\texttimes\,(1\,-\,odds ratio) in a logistic regression model with adjustment for potential confounders. Prior season vaccination associations were assessed with an interaction term.Of 3369 children (1749 [52\%] male; median age, 6.6 years [range, 2-17 years]) included in the analysis, 772 (23\%) had a positive test result for influenza and 1674 (50\%) were vaccinated in the enrollment season. Among LAIV recipients, VE against influenza A(H3N2) was higher among children vaccinated in both the enrollment and 1 prior season (50.3\% [95\% CI, 17.0\% to 70.2\%]) than among those without 1 prior season vaccination (-82.4\% [95\% CI, -267.5\% to 9.5\%], interaction P\,\&lt;\,.001). The effectiveness of LAIV against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was not associated with prior season vaccination among those with prior season vaccination (47.5\% [95\% CI, 11.4\% to 68.9\%]) and among those without prior season vaccination (7.8\% [95\% CI, -101.9\% to 57.9\%]) (interaction P\,=\,.37). Prior season vaccination was not associated with effectiveness of IIV against influenza A(H3N2) (38.7\% [95\% CI, 6.8\% to 59.6\%] among those with prior-season vaccination and 23.2\% [95\% CI, -38.3\% to 57.4\%] among those without prior-season vaccination, interaction P\,=\,.16) or with effectiveness of IIV against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 (72.4\% [95\% CI, 56.0\% to 82.7\%] among those with prior season vaccination and 67.5\% [95\% CI, 32.1\% to 84.4\%] among those without prior season vaccination, interaction P\,=\,.93). Residual protection from prior season vaccination only (no vaccination in the enrollment season) was observed for influenza B (LAIV: 60.0\% [95\% CI, 36.8\% to 74.7\%]; IIV: 60.0\% [36.9\% to 74.6\%]). Similar results were observed in analyses that included repeated vaccination in 2 and 3 prior seasons.Influenza VE varied by influenza type and subtype and vaccine type, but prior-season vaccination was not associated with reduced VE. These findings support current recommendations for annual influenza vaccination of children.},

  abstract = {Background: The effects of sequential vaccination with enhanced influenza vaccines are poorly understood. We conducted an exploratory open-label study to assess serologic response to sequential vaccination in older adults. Methods: 160 adults aged 65 through 74 years were randomized (1:1:1) to receive trivalent inactivated standard dose (SD), high-dose (HD), or MF59-adjuvanted (AD) vaccine in 2016/17. In 2017/18, HD and AD recipients received the same vaccine; SD recipients were re-randomized to HD or AD. Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed using turkey erythrocytes against A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like and B/Brisbane/60/2008(B/Victoria)-like in both seasons, and A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1)-like in season 2. Microneutralization assays were performed against cell-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2)like using MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Postvaccination geometric mean titer (GMT), percent with titer   40, and mean fold rise (MFR, ratio of postvaccination versus prevaccination titer) in season 2 were compared across groups, and ratio of MFR in season 2 versus season 1 was assessed for each strain. Results: Analysis included 152 participants (55 HD ? HD, 58 AD ? AD, 19 SD ? HD, and 20 SD ? AD). Season 2 postvaccination GMTs and percent with titer   40 did not differ between HD ? HD and AD ? AD recipients for vaccine strains examined. However, a higher percent of HD ? HD and AD ? AD recipients had postvaccination titer   40 than SD ? AD recipients for A/H1N1 (86\%-89\% versus 60\%) and SD ? AD and SD ? HD recipients for A/H3N2 (83\%-87\% versus 40\%-53\%). GMTs were higher in AD ? AD versus SD ? AD recipients for A/H1N1 (p = .01) and A/H3N2 (p = .002). MFRs in season 2 were low in all groups for A/H3N2 (1.5\textendash 2.2) and B/Victoria (1.7\textendash 2.3). MFR was lower in season 2 versus 1 for HD ? HD and AD ? AD recipients for all vaccine strains (1.6\textendash 3.7 versus 2.6\textendash 6.2). Conclusions: Sequential vaccination with enhanced vaccines did not reduce immunogenicity in adults aged 65 through 74 years. Serologic response to cell-propagated A/H3N2 was suboptimal for all vaccines. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. NCT02872311 \'O 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) continues to be a public health threat. However, we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune response kinetics to IAV infection and which biological parameters most strongly influence infection outcomes. To address these issues, we use modeling approaches combined with experimental data to quantitatively investigate the innate and adaptive immune responses to primary IAV infection. Mathematical models were developed to describe the dynamic interactions between target (epithelial) cells, influenza virus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and virus-specific IgG and IgM. IAV and immune kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting models to a large data set obtained from primary H3N2 IAV infection of 340 mice. Prior to a detectable virus-specific immune response (before day 5), the estimated half-life of infected epithelial cells is {$\sim$}1.2 days, and the half-life of free infectious IAV is {$\sim$}4 h. During the adaptive immune response (after day 5), the average half-life of infected epithelial cells is {$\sim$}0.5 days, and the average half-life of free infectious virus is {$\sim$}1.8 min. During the adaptive phase, model fitting confirms that CD8+ CTLs are crucial for limiting infected cells, while virus-specific IgM regulates free IAV levels. This may imply that CD4 T cells and class-switched IgG antibodies are more relevant for generating IAV-specific memory and preventing future infection via a more rapid secondary immune response. Also, simulation studies were performed to understand the relative contributions of biological parameters to IAV clearance. This study provides a basis to better understand and predict influenza virus immunity.},

  abstract = {Annually, influenza virus infects millions of people worldwide. Vaccination programs against seasonal influenza infections require the production of hundreds of million doses within a very short period of time. The influenza vaccine is currently produced using a technology developed in the 1940s that relies on replicating the virus in embryonated hens' eggs. The monovalent viral preparation is inactivated and purified before being formulated in trivalent or tetravalent influenza vaccines. The production process has depended on a continuous supply of eggs. In the case of pandemic outbreaks, this mode of production might be problematic because of a possible drastic reduction in the egg supply and the low flexibility of the manufacturing process resulting in a lack of supply of the required vaccine doses in a timely fashion. Novel production systems using mammalian or insect cell cultures have emerged to overcome the limitations of the egg-based production system. These industrially well-established production systems have been primarily selected for a faster and more flexible response to pandemic threats. Here, we review the most important cell culture manufacturing processes that have been developed in recent years for mass production of influenza vaccines.},

  abstract = {Antigenic diversity shapes immunity in distinct and unexpected ways. This is particularly true of the humoral response generated against influenza A viruses. Although it is known that immunological memory developed against previously encountered influenza A virus strains affects the outcome of subsequent infections, exactly how sequential exposures to antigenically variant viruses shape the humoral immune response in humans remains poorly understood. To address this important question, we performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody titers against various pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza virus spanning a 20-year period (1987 to 2008) with samples from 40 individuals (birth dates, 1917 to 1952) obtained from the Framingham Heart Study. Longitudinal increases in neutralizing antibody titers were observed against previously encountered pandemic H2N2, H3N2, and H1N1 influenza A virus strains. Antibody titers against seasonal strains encountered later in life also increased longitudinally at a rate similar to that against their pandemic predecessors. Titers of cross-reactive antibodies specific to the hemagglutinin stalk domain were also investigated because they are influenced by exposure to antigenically diverse influenza A viruses. These titers rose modestly over time, even in the absence of major antigenic shifts. No sustained increase in neutralizing antibody titers against an antigenically more stable virus (human cytomegalovirus) was observed. The results herein describe a role for antigenic variation in shaping the humoral immune compartment and provide a rational basis for the hierarchical nature of antibody titers against influenza A viruses in humans.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, an increasing proportion of circulating human influenza A(H3N2) viruses exhibited haemagglutination activity that was sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. This change in haemagglutination as compared to older circulating A(H3N2) viruses prompted an investigation of the underlying molecular basis. Recent human influenza A(H3N2) viruses were found to agglutinate turkey erythrocytes in a manner that could be blocked with either oseltamivir or neuraminidase-specific antisera, indicating that agglutination was driven by neuraminidase, with a low or negligible contribution of haemagglutinin. Using representative virus recombinants it was shown that the haemagglutinin of a recent A(H3N2) virus indeed had decreased activity to agglutinate turkey erythrocytes, while its neuraminidase displayed increased haemagglutinating activity. Viruses with chimeric and mutant neuraminidases were used to identify the amino acid substitution histidine to arginine at position 150 flanking the neuraminidase catalytic site as the determinant of this neuraminidase-mediated haemagglutination. An analysis of publicly available neuraminidase gene sequences showed that viruses with histidine at position 150 were rapidly replaced by viruses with arginine at this position between 2005 and 2008, in agreement with the phenotypic data. As a consequence of neuraminidase-mediated haemagglutination of recent A(H3N2) viruses and poor haemagglutination via haemagglutinin, haemagglutination inhibition assays with A(H3N2) antisera are no longer useful to characterize the antigenic properties of the haemagglutinin of these viruses for vaccine strain selection purposes. Continuous monitoring of the evolution of these viruses and potential consequences for vaccine strain selection remains important.},

  abstract = {Background Despite preventive efforts, influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality every year in the United States (US). Vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden have been implemented. However, no previous studies have systematically estimated the annual economic burden of influenza epidemics, an estimate necessary to guide policy makers effectively. Objective We estimate age- and risk-specific disease burden, and medical and indirect costs attributable to annual influenza epidemics in the United States. Methods Using a probabilistic model and publicly available epidemiological data we estimated the number of influenza-attributable cases leading to outpatient visits, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as time lost from work absenteeism or premature death. With data from health insurance claims and projections of either earnings or statistical life values, we then estimated healthcare resource utilization associated with influenza cases as were their medical and productivity (indirect) costs in \$2003. Results Based on 2003 US population, we estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost (undiscounted), 3.1million hospitalized days, and 31.4million outpatient visits. Direct medical costs averaged \$10.4billion (95\% confidence interval [C.I.], \$4.1, \$22.2) annually. Projected lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to \$16.3billion (C.I., \$8.7, \$31.0) annually. The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life values amounted to \$87.1billion (C.I., \$47.2, \$149.5). Conclusions These results highlight the enormous annual burden of influenza in the US. While hospitalization costs are important contributors, lost productivity from missed work days and lost lives comprise the bulk of the economic burden of influenza.},

  abstract = {The term "original antigenic sin" was coined approximately 60 years ago to describe the imprinting by the initial first influenza A virus infection on the antibody response to subsequent vaccination. These studies did not suggest a reduction in the response to current antigens but instead suggested anamnestic recall of antibody to earlier influenza virus strains. Then, approximately 40 years ago, it was observed that sequential influenza vaccination might lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE). This conclusion was largely dismissed after an experimental study involving sequential administration of then-standard influenza vaccines. Recent observations have provided convincing evidence that reduced VE after sequential influenza vaccination is a real phenomenon. We propose that such reduction in VE be termed "negative antigenic interaction," given that there is no age cohort effect. In contrast, the potentially positive protective effect of early influenza virus infection later in life continues to be observed. It is essential that we understand better the immunologic factors underlying both original antigenic sin and negative antigenic interaction, to support development of improved influenza vaccines and vaccination strategies.},

Thus, yearly vaccination is recommended, which, together with infections, establishes diverse repertoires of B cells, antibodies, and T cells. We examined the impact of this accumulated immunity on human responses in adults to split, subunit, and recombinant protein-based influenza vaccines. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays, to quantify serum antibodies, and peptide-stimulated CD4 T-cell cytokine ELISpots revealed that preexisting levels of hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies were negatively associated with gains in antibody postvaccination, while preexisting levels of CD4 T cells were negatively correlated with vaccine-induced expansion of CD4 T cells. These patterns were seen independently of the vaccine formulation administered and the subjects' influenza vaccine history. Thus, although memory CD4 T cells and serum antibodies consist of components that can enhance vaccine responses, on balance, the accumulated immunity specific for influenza A H1 and H3 proteins is associated with diminished future responses., The impact of accumulated influenza-specific antibodies and CD4 T cells on human responses to influenza vaccines was examined.

Neuraminidase, the second surface glycoprotein, may also have a role in protection, but little information is available on the immunologic response to this component. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether any response to neuraminidase is evoked by intranasal immunization with a novel, whole, inactivated anti-influenza vaccine. METHODS: This study was part of a more comprehensive study of mucosal and serum immune response to this vaccine. Fifty-four young adults were immunized intranasally, 9 intramuscularly and 18 received a placebo. Twenty-three elderly people were immunized intramuscularly, and 21 elderly and 17 children were immunized intranasally. Serum and nasal antibodies to antigens N1 and N2 were determined by the lectin neuraminidase test. RESULTS: Serum response following intranasal vaccination was lower than after intramuscular vaccination, and ranged from 21.4 to 35.3\% and 33.3 to 64.7\% following intranasal vaccination and from 52.2 to 77.8\% and 47.8 to 88.9\% after intramuscular vaccination, to N1 and N2 respectively. Nasal antibody response was low and was found only after intranasal vaccination, and response to N2 was better than to the N1 antigen. CONCLUSIONS: It may be beneficial if future vaccines would include competent hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which would afford a higher level of protection.},

  abstract = {Seasonal influenza viruses constantly change through antigenic drift and the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses through antigenic shift is unpredictable. Conventional influenza virus vaccines induce strain-specific neutralizing antibodies against the variable immunodominant globular head domain of the viral hemagglutinin protein. This necessitates frequent re-formulation of vaccines and handicaps pandemic preparedness. In this completed, observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I trial (NCT03300050), safety and immunogenicity of chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccines were tested in healthy, 18\textendash 39-year-old US adults. The study aimed to test the safety and ability of the vaccines to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk domain. Participants were enrolled into five groups to receive vaccinations with live-attenuated followed by\,AS03-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine (n\,=\,20), live-attenuated\,followed by\,inactivated vaccine (n\,=\,15), twice AS03-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine (n\,=\,16) or placebo (n\,=\,5, intranasal\,followed by\,intramuscular; n\,=\,10, twice intramuscular) 3\,months apart. Vaccination was found to be safe and induced a broad, strong, durable and functional immune response targeting the conserved, immunosubdominant stalk of the hemagglutinin. The results suggest that chimeric hemagglutinins have the potential to be developed as universal vaccines that protect broadly against influenza viruses.},

  abstract = {It is generally assumed that amino acid mutations in the surface protein, hemagglutinin (HA), of influenza viruses allow these viruses to circumvent neutralization by antibodies induced during infection. However, empirical data on circulating influenza viruses show that certain amino acid changes to HA actually increase the efficiency of neutralization of the mutated virus by antibodies raised against the parent virus. Here, we suggest that this surprising increase in neutralization efficiency after HA mutation could reflect steric interference between antibodies. Specifically, if there is a steric competition for binding to HA by antibodies with different neutralization efficiencies, then a mutation that reduces the binding of antibodies with low neutralization efficiencies could increase overall viral neutralization. We use a mathematical model of virus\textendash antibody interaction to elucidate the conditions under which amino acid mutations to HA could lead to an increase in viral neutralization. Using insights gained from the model, together with genetic and structural data, we predict that amino acid mutations to epitopes C and E of the HA of influenza A/H3N2 viruses could lead on average to an increase in the neutralization of the mutated viruses. We present data supporting this prediction and discuss the implications for the design of more effective vaccines against influenza viruses and other pathogens.},

  abstract = {Immunity to influenza is unique among pathogens, in that immune memory is established both via intermittent lung localized infections with highly variable influenza virus strains and by intramuscular vaccinations with inactivated protein-based vaccines. Studies in the past decades have suggested that the B cell responses to influenza infection and vaccination are highly biased by an individual's early history of influenza infection. This reactivity likely reflects both the competitive advantage that memory B cells have in an immune response and the relatively limited diversity of epitopes in influenza hemagglutinin that are recognized by B cells. In contrast, CD4 T cells recognize a wide array of epitopes, with specificities that are heavily influenced by the diversity of influenza antigens available, and a multiplicity of functions that are determined by both priming events and subsequent confrontations with antigens. Here, we consider the events that prime and remodel the influenza-specific CD4 T cell response in humans that have highly diverse immune histories and how the CD4 repertoire may be edited in terms of functional potential and viral epitope specificity. We discuss the consequences that imprinting and remodeling may have on the potential of different human hosts to rapidly respond with protective cellular immunity to infection. Finally, these issues are discussed in the context of future avenues of investigation and vaccine strategies.},

Seasonal influenza virus vaccines can prevent infection, but are rendered ineffective by antigenic drift. To provide improved protection from infection, novel influenza virus vaccines that target the conserved epitopes of influenza viruses, specifically those in the hemagglutinin stalk and neuraminidase, are currently being developed3. Antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk confer protection in animal studies4-6. However, no data exist on natural infections in humans, and these antibodies do not show activity in the hemagglutination inhibition assay, the hemagglutination inhibition titer being the current correlate of protection against influenza virus infection7-9. While previous studies have investigated the protective effect of cellular immune responses and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies, additional serological correlates of protection from infection could aid the development of broadly protective or universal influenza virus vaccines10-13. To address this gap, we performed a household transmission study to identify alternative correlates of protection from infection and disease in naturally exposed individuals. Using this study, we determined 50\% protective titers and levels for hemagglutination inhibition, full-length hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and hemagglutinin stalk-specific antibodies. Further, we found that hemagglutinin stalk antibodies independently correlated with protection from influenza virus infection.},

  abstract = {Summary: Activation of the humoral immune system by microbial infections or self-antigens results in the initiation of strong pro-inflammatory reactions. Antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype play a crucial role in this cascade of reactions, resulting in the clearance of invading microbes and the generation of long lasting immunity. In addition, IgG antibodies feedback on the generation of novel IgG antibodies by activated B cells, impact plasma cell survival, and participate actively in maintaining and returning to the steady state. This review focuses on our current models of how IgG molecules can have this diverse array of activities.},

  abstract = {Most humans have pre-existing immunity to influenza viruses. In this study, volunteers (ages of 18-85 years) were vaccinated with split, inactivated Fluzone\texttrademark{} influenza vaccine in four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2016 seasons. The impact of repeated vaccination on breadth and durability of antibodies was assessed as a result of vaccine strain changes. Total IgG anti-hemagglutinin (HA) binding antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity increased in all age groups against both influenza A HA components in the vaccine post-vaccination (day 21). However, younger subjects maintained seroprotective titers to the vaccine strains, which resulted in higher seroconversion rates in the elderly, since the HAI titers in elderly subjects were more likely to decline prior to the next season. Young subjects had significant HAI activity against historical, as well as contemporary H1 and H3 vaccine strains from the mid-1980s to present. In contrast, elderly subjects had HAI activity to H1 strains from all years, but were more likely to have HAI activity to older strains from 1918-1950s. They also had a more restricted HAI profile against H3 viruses compared to young subjects recognizing H3N2 influenza viruses from the mid-2000s to present. Vaccine recipients were then categorized by whether subjects seroconverted from a seronegative or seropositive pre-vaccination state. Regardless of age, immunological recall or 'back-boosting' to antigenically related strains were associated with seroconversion to the vaccine strain. Overall, both younger and older people have the ability to mount a breadth of immune responses following influenza vaccination. This report describes how imprinting exposure differs across age groups, influences antibody cross-reactivity to past hemagglutinin antigenic variants, and shapes immune responses elicited by current split inactivated influenza vaccines. Understanding how current influenza vaccines are influenced by pre-existing immunity in people of different ages is critical for designing the next-generation of 'universal' or broadly-protective influenza vaccines.},

Failure to differentiate between cohort effects caused by differences in the set, rather than the order (path), of past infections is a current source of confusion.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine (H7N9 IIV) in healthy adults. Group 1 received H7N9 IIV and seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) simultaneously, followed by H7N9 IIV three weeks later. Group 2 received IIV4 alone and then two doses of H7N9 IIV at three-week intervals. Group 3 received one dose of IIV4. We used hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) assays to measure geometric mean titers and seroprotection ({$\geq$}1:40 titer) to vaccine strains and monitored for safety. RESULTS: Among 149 subjects, seroprotection by HAI three weeks after H7N9 IIV dose 2 was 51\% (95~\%CI 37\%-65\%) for Group 1 and 40\% (95~\%CI 25\%-56\%) for Group 2. Seroprotection by MN at the same timepoint was 84\% (95~\%CI 72\%-93\%) for Group 1 and 74\% (95~\%CI 60\%-86\%) for Group 2. By 180~days after H7N9 IIV dose 2, seroprotection by HAI or MN was low for Groups 1 and 2. Responses measured by HAI and MN against each IIV4 strain three weeks after IIV4 vaccination were similar in all groups. Solicited local and systemic reactions were similar after a single vaccination, while those receiving simultaneous H7N9 and IIV4 had slightly more reactogenicity. There were no serious adverse events or medically-attended adverse events related to study product receipt. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvanted H7N9 IIV was modestly immunogenic whether administered simultaneously or sequentially with IIV4, though responses declined by 180~days. IIV4 was immunogenic regardless of schedule. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT03318315.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus infection remains a public health problem worldwide. The mechanisms underlying viral control during an uncomplicated influenza virus infection are not fully understood. Here, we developed a mathematical model including both innate and adaptive immune responses to study the within-host dynamics of equine influenza virus infection in horses. By comparing modeling predictions with both interferon and viral kinetic data, we examined the relative roles of target cell availability, and innate and adaptive immune responses in controlling the virus. Our results show that the rapid and substantial viral decline (about 2 to 4 logs within 1 day) after the peak can be explained by the killing of infected cells mediated by interferon activated cells, such as natural killer cells, during the innate immune response. After the viral load declines to a lower level, the loss of interferon-induced antiviral effect and an increased availability of target cells due to loss of the antiviral state can explain the observed short phase of viral plateau in which the viral level remains unchanged or even experiences a minor second peak in some animals. An adaptive immune response is needed in our model to explain the eventual viral clearance. This study provides a quantitative understanding of the biological factors that can explain the viral and interferon kinetics during a typical influenza virus infection., Influenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza virus infections. Although most infected subjects with intact immune systems are able to clear the virus without developing serious flu complications, the mechanisms underlying viral control are not fully understood. In this paper, we address this question by developing mathematical models that include both innate and adaptive immune responses, and fitting them to experimental data from horses infected with equine influenza virus. We find that the innate immune response, such as natural killer cell-mediated infected cell killing and interferon's antiviral effect, can explain the first rapid viral decline and subsequent second peak viremia, and that the adaptive immune response is needed to eventually clear the virus. This study improves our understanding of influenza virus dynamics and may provide more information for future research in influenza pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccination.},

Recent evidence suggesting that obesity leads to tissue-specific vitamin A deficiency led to an investigation of whether high-dose oral vitamin A, a treatment used for remediating vitamin A deficiency in developing countries, could correct obesity-associated tissue deficits. METHODS: Adult C57BL/6 diet-induced obese mice were supplemented with vitamin A for 4~weeks. A subset of mice were then vaccinated with inactivated influenza virus and challenged. Following supplementation, tissue vitamin A levels, lung immune cell composition, blood inflammatory cytokines, antibody responses, and viral clearance were evaluated. RESULTS: Supplementation significantly improved vitamin A levels in lung and adipose tissues in diet-induced obese mice. Additionally, supplementation decreased inflammatory cytokines in the blood and altered the lung immune environment. Importantly, vaccinated, vitamin A-treated diet-induced obese mice exhibited improved antibody responses and significantly reduced viral loads post challenge compared with PBS-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate a low-cost intervention that may correct vitamin A tissue deficits and help control respiratory viral infections in individuals with obesity.},

Here, we ask how the timing of vaccination affects outcomes. Results demonstrate significant influences of inoculation month on the immune response. During the progression from fall to winter months, there are changes in host lifestyles and in the frequencies of clinical/sub-clinical viral infections that can significantly alter vaccine immunogenicity. We now recommend routine assessment of inoculation month during clinical studies to inform data interpretation and expedite the development of successful vaccines. This recommendation is pertinent to numerous vaccine development efforts within and outside the influenza virus field.},

  abstract = {Influenza A viruses evolve rapidly to escape host immunity, such that individuals can be infected multiple times with the same subtype. The form and duration of protective immunity after each influenza infection are poorly understood. Here, we quantify the dynamics of protective immunity against influenza A virus infections by fitting individual-level mechanistic models to longitudinal serology from children and adults in a household cohort study. We find that most protection in children is explained by antibody titers measured by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. In contrast, in adults, HI antibody titers explain a smaller fraction of protection. Protection against circulating strains wanes to approximately 50\% of peak levels 3.5-7 years after infection in both age groups, and wanes faster against influenza A(H3N2) than A(H1N1)pdm09. Protection against H3N2 lasts longer in adults than in children. Our results suggest that the focus of influenza antibody responses changes over time from the highly mutable hemagglutinin head to other epitopes, consistent with the immunological theory of original antigenic sin, and that this change of focus might affect protection. Additionally, we estimate that imprinting, or primary infection with a subtype of one phylogenetic group, has little to no effect on the risk of non-medically attended influenza infections in adults. We also find no evidence of long-term cross-protection between subtypes. This work underscores the need for longitudinal data on multiple components of the immune response to better understand the development of immunity and differences in susceptibility within populations.},

  abstract = {In the United States, it is recommended that healthcare providers offer influenza vaccination by October, if possible. However, if the vaccine's effectiveness soon begins to wane, the optimal time for vaccination may be somewhat later. We examined whether the effectiveness of influenza vaccine wanes during the influenza season with increasing time since vaccination.We identified persons who were vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine from 1 September 2010 to 31 March 2017 and who were subsequently tested for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by a polymerase chain reaction test. Test-confirmed influenza was the primary outcome and days-since-vaccination was the predictor of interest in conditional logistic regression. Models were adjusted for age and conditioned on calendar day and geographic area. RSV was used as a negative-control outcome.Compared with persons vaccinated 14 to 41 days prior to being tested, persons vaccinated 42 to 69 days prior to being tested had 1.32 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11 to 1.55) times the odds of testing positive for any influenza. The odds ratio (OR) increased linearly by approximately 16\% for each additional 28 days since vaccination. The OR was 2.06 (95\% CI, 1.69 to 2.51) for persons vaccinated 154 or more days prior to being tested. No evidence of waning was found for RSV.Our results suggest that effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine wanes during the course of a single season. These results may lead to reconsideration of the optimal timing of seasonal influenza vaccination.},

Here, we have assessed human CD4 T cell responses to a traditional egg-based influenza vaccine with recently available cell-derived vaccines and recombinant baculovirus-derived vaccines. Adults were administered either egg-derived Fluzone\textregistered, mammalian cell-derived Flucelvax\textregistered{} or recombinant HA (Flublok\textregistered ). CD4 T cell responses to each HA protein were assessed by cytokine EliSpot and intracellular staining assays. The specificity and magnitude of antibody responses were quantified by ELISA and HAI assays. By all criteria, Flublok vaccine exhibited superior performance in eliciting both CD4 T cell responses and HA-specific antibody responses, whether measured by mean response magnitude or percent of responders. Although the mechanism(s) underlying this advantage is not yet clear, it is likely that both qualitative and quantitative features of the vaccines impact the response.},

  abstract = {Fluzone\textregistered{} High-Dose (IIV3-HD) is a trivalent, inactivated, split-virus influenza vaccine indicated for use in older adults ({$\geq$}65~years of age). It contains 60~\textmu g hemagglutinin of each influenza strain, which is four times the hemagglutinin content of standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluzone (IIV3-SD). IIV3-HD has been licensed for use in older adults in the US since December 2009 and in Canada since February 2016. Areas covered: In this review, we summarize postlicensure studies on the immunogenicity, safety, and effectiveness of IIV3-HD and estimates of its cost-effectiveness in older adults. We also discuss the potential application of IIV3-HD in adults 50-64~years of age and in individuals who may respond poorly to standard-dose influenza vaccines. Expert commentary: Multiple studies conducted since 2004 have consistently shown that, in older adults, IIV3-HD induces substantially greater antibody responses and better protection against influenza and influenza-associated hospitalization than IIV3-SD. Health economic analyses suggest that IIV3-HD can be a cost-effective alternative to standard-dose trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines and can even be cost-saving compared to IIV3-SD in older adults. Further investigation of IIV3-HD vaccination as a way to improve immune responses and protection against influenza in immunocompromised individuals is warranted.},

At Days 0 and 21, sera were tested for hemagglutination-inhibition titers against these vaccine strains and at Day 0 against a panel of 15 historical seasonal strains.Results: The proportions of participants with seroprotective titers {$\geq$}1:40 to the vaccine strains at Days 0 and 21, respectively, were 37\% and 66\% for A(H1N1) and 28\% and 63\% for A(H3N2). An increasing number of responses {$\geq$}1:40 against historical strains was associated with seroprotective responses after vaccination among participants with a titer {$<$}1:40 at Day 0 for A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) vaccine strains (P {$<$} 0.01). In multivariable regression analyses among those with Day 0 titer {$<$}1:40, after controlling for age, sex, race, site and diabetes, Day 21 titers {$\geq$} 1:40 for the vaccine A strains were significantly more likely as the number of seroprotective responses against historical strains increased (A(H1N1) odds ratio [OR] = 1.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09\textendash 1.82 and A(H3N2) OR = 1.32, 95\% CI = 1.07\textendash 1.62). The likelihood of seroconversion was significantly higher with an increasing number of responses to historical strains for A(H3N2) only (OR = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.01\textendash 1.52). Seroconversion was significantly less likely as Day 0 vaccine strain titers increased.Conclusions: Seroprotective titers after influenza vaccination increased as the number of responses to historical strains increased.},

  abstract = {Older adults ({$\geq$}65 years of age) bear a significant burden of severe disease and mortality associated with influenza, despite relatively high annual vaccination coverage and substantial pre-existing immunity to influenza. To test the hypothesis that host factors, including age and sex, play a role in determining the effect of repeat vaccination and levels of pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza, we evaluated pre- and post-vaccination strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in adults over 75 years of age who received a high-dose influenza vaccine in at least four out of six influenza seasons (NCT02200276). Neither age, sex, body mass index, frailty, nor repeat vaccination were significantly associated with post-vaccination HAI titer outcomes. Pre-vaccination titers, however, were significantly predictive of post-vaccination outcomes. Pre-vaccination titers to H1N1 remained constant with age, while those to H3N2 and influenza B decreased substantially with age in males but not in females. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-existing immunity in this highly vaccinated older adult population and suggest that older males are particularly vulnerable to reduced pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza from previous annual vaccination.},

  abstract = {The hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein is the primary immune target for most influenza vaccines. The neuraminidase (NA) surface protein is often a secondary target for vaccine designs. In this study, computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology was used to generate the N1-I NA vaccine antigen that was designed to cross-react with avian, swine, and human influenza viruses of the N1 NA subtype. The elicited antibodies bound to NA proteins derived from A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Swine/North Carolina/154074/2015 (H1N1), and A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) influenza viruses, with NA-neutralizing activity against a broad panel of HXN1 influenza strains. Mice vaccinated with the N1-I COBRA NA vaccine were protected from mortality and viral lung titers were lower when challenged with four different viral challenges (A/California/07/2009, A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Swine/North Carolina/154074/2015, and A/Viet Nam/1203/2004). Vaccinated mice had little to no weight loss against both homologous, but also cross-NA, genetic clade challenges. Lung viral titers were lower than the mock-vaccinated mice and, at times, equivalent to the homologous control. Thus, the N1-I COBRA NA antigen has the potential to be a complementary component in a multiantigen universal influenza virus vaccine formulation that also contains HA antigens. IMPORTANCE The development and distribution of a universal influenza vaccine would alleviate global economic and public health stress from annual influenza virus outbreaks. The influenza virus NA vaccine antigen allows for protection from multiple HA subtypes and virus host origins, but it has not been the focus of vaccine development. The N1-I NA antigen described here protected mice from direct challenge of four distinct influenza viruses and inhibited the enzymatic activity of an N1 influenza virus panel. The use of the NA antigen in combination with the HA antigen widens the breadth of protection against various virus strains. Therefore, this research opens the door to the development of a longer-lasting vaccine with increased protective breadth.},

Epidemiological data reveal that of all the people afflicted with H1N1 virus, {$<$}5\% are over 51 y of age. Interestingly, in the uninfected population, 33\% of those {$>$}60 y old have pre-existing neutralizing Abs against the 2009 H1N1 virus. This finding suggests that influenza strains that circulated 50\textendash 60 y ago might provide cross-protection against the swine-origin 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. To test this, we determined the ability of representative H1N1 influenza viruses that circulated in the human population from 1930 to 2000, to induce cross-reactivity to and cross-protection against the pandemic swine-origin H1N1 virus, A/California/04/09. We show that exposure of mice to the 1947 virus, A/FM/1/47, or the 1934 virus, A/PR/8/34, induced robust cross-protective immune responses and these mice were protected against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted A/California/04/09 H1N1 virus. Conversely, we observed that mice exposed to the 2009 H1N1 virus were protected against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted 1947 or 1934 H1N1 viruses. In addition, exposure to the 2009 H1N1 virus induced broad cross-reactivity against H1N1 as well as H3N2 influenza viruses. Finally, we show that vaccination with the older H1N1 viruses, particularly A/FM/1/47, confers protective immunity against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Taken together, our data provide an explanation for the decreased susceptibility of the elderly to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak and demonstrate that vaccination with the pre-1950 influenza strains can cross-protect against the pandemic swine-origin 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.},

Aim To explain a paradoxical signal of increased clade 3C.3a risk among 35\textendash 54-year-old vaccinees, we hypothesise childhood immunological imprinting and a cohort effect following the 1968 influenza A(H3N2) pandemic. Methods We assessed VE by test-negative design for influenza A(H3N2) overall and for co-circulating clades 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a. VE variation by age in 2018/19 was compared with amino acid variation in the haemagglutinin glycoprotein by year since 1968. Results Influenza A(H3N2) VE was 17\% (95\% CI: -13 to 39) overall: 27\% (95\% CI: -7 to 50) for 3C.2a1b and -32\% (95\% CI: -119 to 21) for 3C.3a. Among 20\textendash 64-year-olds, VE was -7\% (95\% CI: -56 to 26): 6\% (95\% CI: -49 to 41) for 3C.2a1b and -96\% (95\% CI: -277 to -2) for 3C.3a. Clade 3C.3a VE showed a pronounced negative dip among 35\textendash 54-year-olds in whom the odds of medically attended illness were \&gt; 4-fold increased for vaccinated vs unvaccinated participants (p \&lt; 0.005). This age group was primed in childhood to influenza A(H3N2) viruses that for two decades following the 1968 pandemic bore a serine at haemagglutinin position 159, in common with contemporary 3C.3a viruses but mismatched to 3C.2a vaccine strains instead bearing tyrosine. Discussion Imprinting by the first childhood influenza infection is known to confer long-lasting immunity focused toward priming epitopes. Our findings suggest vaccine mismatch may negatively interact with imprinted immunity. The immunological mechanisms for imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV) warrant investigation.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus frequently mutates due to its error-prone polymerase. This feature contributes to influenza virus's ability to evade pre-existing immunity, leading to annual epidemics and periodic pandemics. T cell memory plays a key protective role in the face of an antigenically distinct influenza virus strain because T cell targets are often derived from conserved internal proteins, whereas humoral immunity targets are often sites of increased mutation rates that are tolerated by the virus. Most studies of influenza T cell memory are conducted in naive, specific pathogen free mice and do not account for repetitive influenza infection throughout a lifetime, sequential acute heterologous infections between influenza infections, or heterologous chronic co-infections. By contrast to these mouse models, humans often experience numerous influenza infections, encounter heterologous acute infections between influenza infections, and are infected with at least one chronic virus. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the effects of heterologous infections on the establishment and maintenance of CD8+ T cell immunological memory. Understanding the various factors that affect immune memory can provide insights into the development of more effective vaccines and increase reproducibility of translational studies between animal models and clinical results.},

Furthermore the same procedures showed that one molecule of mab per trimer prevented the binding of polyclonal HA-specific IgG obtained from the serum of rabbits immunized with whole virus. This restricted binding is clearly a property of the intact virion, since others using purified HA have shown that up to four IgG molecules of different specificities can bind per trimer. Since the surface area of the globular head of the trimer is equivalent to approximately 10 nonoverlapping antibody footprints, it is not understood how one prebound IgG molecule prevents the binding of other IgG molecules.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, lower estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) virus illness among those vaccinated during the previous season or multiple seasons have been reported; however, it is unclear whether these effects are due to differences in immunogenicity. METHODS: We performed hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HI) assays on serum collected at preseason, {$\sim$} 30 days post-vaccination, and postseason from a prospective cohort of healthcare personnel (HCP). Eligible participants had medical and vaccination records for at least four years (since July, 2006), including 578 HCP who received 2010-11 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV3, containing A/Perth/16/2009-like A(H3N2)] and 209 HCP who declined vaccination. Estimates of the percentage with high titers ({$\geq$} 40 and{$>$}100) and geometric mean fold change ratios (GMRs) to A/Perth/16/2009-like virus by number of prior vaccinations were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, household size, hospital care responsibilities, and study site. RESULTS: Post-vaccination GMRs were inversely associated with the number of prior vaccinations, increasing from 2.3 among those with 4 prior vaccinations to 6.2 among HCP with zero prior vaccinations (F[4,567]=9.97, p{$<$}.0005). Thirty-two percent of HCP with 1 prior vaccination achieved titers {$>$}100 compared to only 11\% of HCP with 4 prior vaccinations (adjusted odds ratio=6.8, 95\% CI=3.1 - 15.3). CONCLUSION: Our findings point to an exposure-response association between repeated IIV3 vaccination and HI for A(H3N2) and are consistent with recent VE observations. Ultimately, better vaccines and vaccine strategies may be needed in order to optimize immunogenicity and VE for HCP and other repeated vaccinees.},

One study found decreases of 6\textendash 11\%/month during the 2011\textendash 2012 to 2014\textendash 2015 seasons. These findings could indicate waning immunity but could also occur if vaccine effectiveness is stable and vaccine provides partial protection in all vaccinees (``leaky'') rather than complete protection in a subset of vaccinees. Since it is unknown whether influenza vaccine is leaky, we simulated the 2011\textendash 2012 to 2014\textendash 2015 influenza seasons to estimate the potential contribution of leaky vaccine effect to the observed decline in mVE.We used available data to estimate daily numbers of vaccinations and infections with A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses. We assumed that vaccine effect was leaky, calculated mVE as 1 minus the Mantel-Haenszel relative risk of vaccine on incident cases, and determined the mean mVE change per 30 days since vaccination. Because change in mVE was highly dependent on infection rates, we performed simulations using low (15\%) and high (31\%) total (including symptomatic and asymptomatic) seasonal infection rates.For the low infection rate, decreases (absolute) in mVE per 30 days after vaccination were 2\% for A/H1N1 and 1\% for A/H3N2and B viruses. For the high infection rate, decreases were 5\% for A/H1N1, 4\% for A/H3, and 3\% for B viruses.The leaky vaccine bias could account for some, but probably not all, of the observed intraseasonal decreases in mVE. These results underscore the need for strategies to deal with intraseasonal vaccine effectiveness decline.},

The first attempts have revealed a high level of complexity in establishing influenza immunity, and many different cellular and molecular components are involved. Of note is that the previously identified correlates of protection fail to account for the majority of individual responses across different age groups and influenza seasons. Challenges remain from the small sample sizes in most studies and from often limited data sets, such as transcriptomic data. Here we report the creation of a unified database, FluPRINT, to enable large-scale studies exploring the cellular and molecular underpinnings of successful antibody responses to influenza vaccines. Over 3,000 parameters were considered, including serological responses to influenza strains, serum cytokines, cell phenotypes, and cytokine stimulations. FluPRINT, facilitates the application of machine learning algorithms for data mining. The data are publicly available and represent a resource to uncover new markers and mechanisms that are important for influenza vaccine immunogenicity.},

Constructing such models requires the collection of dense measurements of system states, yet transformation of data into predictive constructs remains a challenge. To begin to model human immunity, we analyzed immune parameters in depth both at baseline and in response to influenza vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptomes, serum titers, cell subpopulation frequencies, and B cell responses were assessed in 63 individuals before and after vaccination and were used to develop a systematic framework to dissect inter- and intra-individual variation and build predictive models of postvaccination antibody responses. Strikingly, independent of age and pre-existing antibody titers, accurate models could be constructed using pre-perturbation cell populations alone, which were validated using independent baseline time points. Most of the parameters contributing to prediction delineated temporally stable baseline differences across individuals, raising the prospect of immune monitoring before intervention.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen that can cause disease in humans, with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. The vast majority of influenza virus infections in humans are observed during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Given the substantial public health burden associated with influenza virus infection, yearly vaccination is recommended for protection against seasonal influenza viruses. Despite vigilant surveillance for new variants and careful selection of seasonal vaccine strains, the efficacy of seasonal vaccines can vary widely from year to year. This often results in lowered protection within the population, regardless of vaccination status. In order to broaden the protection afforded by seasonal influenza vaccines, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has deemed the development of a universal influenza virus vaccine to be a priority in influenza virus vaccine research. This universal vaccine would provide protection against all influenza virus strains, eliminating the need for the yearly reformulations of seasonal influenza vaccines. In addition to universal influenza vaccine efforts, substantial progress has been made in developing novel influenza virus therapeutics that utilize broadly neutralizing antibodies to provide protection against influenza virus infection and to mitigate disease outcomes during infection. In this review, we discuss various approaches toward the goal of improving influenza virus vaccine efficacy through a universal influenza virus vaccine. We also address the novel methods of discovery and utilization of broadly neutralizing antibodies to improve influenza disease outcomes.},

Methods: In a cohort of 138 older adults (50-74 years old), we measured influenza A/H1N1 antibody titers, B-cell ELISPOT response, PBMC transcriptomics, and PBMC cell compositions at 0, 3, and 28 days post-immunization with the 2010/11 seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. Results: We identified higher B-cell ELISPOT responses in females than males. Potential mechanisms for sex effects were identified in four gene clusters related to T, NK, and B cells. Mediation analysis indicated that sex-dependent expression in T and NK cell genes can be partially attributed to higher CD4+ T cell and lower NK cell fractions in females. We identified strong sex effects in 135 B cell genes whose expression correlates with ELISPOT measures, and found that cell subset differences did not explain the effect of sex on these genes' expression. Post-vaccination expression of these genes, however, mediated 41\% of the sex effect on ELISPOT responses.

  abstract = {Prime-boost vaccinations of humans with different H5 strains have generated broadly protective antibody levels. However, the effect of an individual's H5 exposure history on antibody responses to subsequent H5 vaccination is poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed the IgG responses to H5 influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Ind05) virus vaccination in three cohorts: (i) a doubly primed group that had received two H5 virus vaccinations, namely, against influenza A/Vietnam/203/2004 (Vie04) virus 5\,years prior and A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (HK97) 11\,years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; (ii) a singly primed group that had received a vaccination against Vie04 virus 5\,years prior to the Ind05 vaccination; and (iii) an H5-naive group that received two doses of the Ind05 vaccine 28\,days apart. Hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive IgG levels were estimated by a multiplex assay against an HA panel that included 21 H5 strains and 9 other strains representing the H1, H3, H7, and H9 subtypes. Relative HA antibody landscapes were generated to quantitatively analyze the magnitude and breadth of antibody binding after vaccination. We found that short-interval priming and boosting with the Ind05 vaccine in the naive group generated a low anti-H5 response. Both primed groups generated robust antibody responses reactive to a broad range of H5 strains after receiving a booster injection of Ind05 vaccine; IgG antibody levels persisted longer in subjects who had been doubly primed years ago. Notably, the IgG responses were strongest against the first priming H5 strain, which reflects influenza virus immune imprinting. Finally, the broad anti-H5 IgG response was stronger against strains having a small antigenic distance from the initial priming strain. IMPORTANCE The antigenic shift and draft of hemagglutinin (HA) in influenza viruses is accepted as one of the major reasons for immune evasion. The analysis of B cell immune responses to influenza infection and vaccination is complicated by the impact of exposure history and antibody cross-reactions between antigenically similar influenza strains. To assist in such analyses, the influenza "antibody landscape" method has been used to analyze and visualize the relationship of antibody-mediated immunity to antigenic distances between influenza strains. In this study, we describe a "relative antibody landscape" method that calculates the antigenic distance between the vaccine influenza strain and other H5 strains and uses this relative antigenic distance to plot the anti-H5 IgG levels postvaccination. This new method quantitatively estimates and visualizes the correlation between the humoral response to a particular influenza strain and the antigenic distance from other strains. Our findings demonstrate the effect of a subject's H5 exposure history on H5 vaccine responses quantified by the relative antibody landscape method.},

Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of influenza A virus RNA segments coding for the spike proteins (HA, NA, and M2) and the internal proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from a wide range of hosts, geographical regions, and influenza A virus subtypes support the following conclusions. (i) Two partly overlapping reservoirs of influenza A viruses exist in migrating waterfowl and shorebirds throughout the world. These species harbor influenza viruses of all the known HA and NA subtypes. (ii) Influenza viruses have evolved into a number of host-specific lineages that are exemplified by the NP gene and include equine Prague/56, recent equine strains, classical swine and human strains, H13 gull strains, and all other avian strains. Other genes show similar patterns, but with extensive evidence of genetic reassortment. Geographical as well as host-specific lineages are evident. (iii) All of the influenza A viruses of mammalian sources originated from the avian gene pool, and it is possible that influenza B viruses also arose from the same source. (iv) The different virus lineages are predominantly host specific, but there are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes or whole viruses between species, giving rise to pandemics of disease in humans, lower animals, and birds. (v) The influenza viruses currently circulating in humans and pigs in North America originated by transmission of all genes from the avian reservoir prior to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic; some of the genes have subsequently been replaced by others from the influenza gene pool in birds. (vi) The influenza virus gene pool in aquatic birds of the world is probably perpetuated by low-level transmission within that species throughout the year. (vii) There is evidence that most new human pandemic strains and variants have originated in southern China. (viii) There is speculation that pigs may serve as the intermediate host in genetic exchange between influenza viruses in avian and humans, but experimental evidence is lacking. (ix) Once the ecological properties of influenza viruses are understood, it may be possible to interdict the introduction of new influenza viruses into humans.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Older adults are prioritized for influenza vaccination but also have lowered antibody responses to the vaccine. Higher-doses of influenza antigen may increase immune response and thus be more effective. Our objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety of the high-dose influenza vaccine to the standard-dose influenza vaccine in the elderly (age{$>$}65). METHODS: Data sources: Randomized trials (RCTs) from Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently identified RCTs comparing high-dose influenza vaccine (60{$\mu$}g of hemagglutinin per strain) to standard-dose influenza vaccine (15{$\mu$}g of hemagglutinin per strain) in adults over the age of 65years. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and funding sources. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: We included seven eligible trials; all were categorized as having a low (n=3) or unclear (n=4) risk of bias. Patients receiving the high-dose vaccine had significantly less risk of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections (Relative Risk 0.76, 95\%CI 0.65 to 0.90; I2 0\%, 2 trials, 41,141 patients). Post-vaccination geometric mean titres and seroprotection rates were also higher in high-dose vaccine recipients. There were no protocol-defined serious adverse events in the included trials in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly adults, the high-dose influenza vaccine was well-tolerated, more immunogenic, and more efficacious in preventing influenza infections than the standard-dose vaccine. Further pragmatic trials are needed to determine if the higher efficacy translates into higher vaccine effectiveness in adults over the age of 65.},

Here, we mapped the epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza vaccination in humans at the single-cell level. Vaccination against seasonal influenza induced persistently diminished H3K27ac in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), which was associated with impaired cytokine responses to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, this vaccine also stimulated persistently increased chromatin accessibility at interferon response factor (IRF) loci in monocytes and mDCs. This was associated with elevated expression of antiviral genes and heightened resistance to the unrelated Zika and Dengue viruses. These results demonstrate that vaccination stimulates persistent epigenomic remodeling of the innate immune system and reveal AS03's potential as an epigenetic adjuvant.},

Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8\% of participants during a roughly four-year interval, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest titer rise. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers at baseline reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion against recent strains among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Including immunity to previously exposures also improved the deviance explained by the models. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza infection.},

Original antigenic sin (OAS) describes the observation that antibodies to the first encountered influenza strain, specifically antibodies to the epitopes on the head of influenza's main surface glycoprotein, haemagglutinin (HA), dominate following infection with new drifted strains. OAS suggests that responses to the original strain are preferentially boosted. Recent studies also show limited boosting of the antibodies to conserved epitopes on the stem of HA, which are attractive targets for a `universal vaccine'. We develop multi-epitope models to explore how pre-existing immunity modulates the immune response to new strains following immunization. Our models suggest that the masking of antigenic epitopes by antibodies may play an important role in describing the complex dynamics of OAS and limited boosting of antibodies to the stem of HA. Analysis of recently published data confirms model predictions for how pre-existing antibodies to an epitope on HA decrease the magnitude of boosting of the antibody response to this epitope following immunization.

  abstract = {The development of next-generation influenza vaccines that elicit strain-transcendent immunity against both seasonal and pandemic viruses is a key public health goal. Targeting the evolutionarily conserved epitopes on the stem of influenza's major surface molecule, hemagglutinin, is an appealing prospect, and novel vaccine formulations show promising results in animal model systems. However, studies in humans indicate that natural infection and vaccination result in limited boosting of antibodies to the stem of HA, and the level of stem-specific antibody elicited is insufficient to provide broad strain-transcendent immunity. Here, we use mathematical models of the humoral immune response to explore how pre-existing immunity affects the ability of vaccines to boost antibodies to the head and stem of HA in humans, and, in particular, how it leads to the apparent lack of boosting of broadly cross-reactive antibodies to the stem epitopes. We consider hypotheses where binding of antibody to an epitope: (i) results in more rapid clearance of the antigen; (ii) leads to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes which inhibit B cell activation through Fc{$\gamma$} receptor-mediated mechanism; and (iii) masks the epitope and prevents the stimulation and proliferation of specific B cells. We find that only epitope masking but not the former two mechanisms to be key in recapitulating patterns in data. We discuss the ramifications of our findings for the development of vaccines against both seasonal and pandemic influenza., The current influenza vaccine requires frequent updating in order to protect against small changes in the virus from one year to the next as well as larger changes associated with the emergence of new influenza strains from zoonotic reservoirs that cause pandemics. There is a considerable interest in developing ``universal'' vaccines that will boost immune responses to the conserved regions of the virus, in particular, to the stem region of the major virus surface molecule hemagglutinin (HA). However, recent data reveals that vaccination results in very limited boosting of antibodies to the stem of HA. We use mathematical models to explore different hypotheses that may explain why vaccination does not boost antibodies to the conserved parts of the virus. By confronting our models with the data from the human vaccination trials we found that the key mechanism preventing effective boosting of the responses to the stem of HA is masking of the stem by pre-existing antibodies developed during previous infections and vaccinations. We discuss how this masking effect could be overcome in a ``universal'' influenza vaccine.},

Average postvaccination antibody titers were similar across successive vaccinations, but the rate of antibody waning increased with each vaccination. The antibody half-life was estimated to decrease from 32 months (95\% credible interval [CrI], 22\textendash 61 months) following first vaccination to 9 months (95\% CrI, 7\textendash 15 months) following a seventh vaccination.Although the rate of antibody waning increased with successive vaccination, the estimated antibody half-life was longer than a typical influenza season even among the most highly vaccinated. This supports current recommendations for vaccination at the earliest opportunity. Patterns of boosting and waning might be different with the influenza A(H3N2) subtype, which evolves more rapidly and has been most associated with reduced effectiveness following repeat vaccination.},

  abstract = {Failure to achieve a protected state after influenza vaccination is poorly understood but occurs commonly among aged populations experiencing greater immunosenescence. In order to better understand immune response in the elderly, we studied epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles and humoral immune response outcomes in 50-74 year old healthy participants. Associations between DNA methylation and gene expression reveal a system-wide regulation of immune-relevant functions, likely playing a role in regulating a participant's propensity to respond to vaccination. Our findings show that sites of methylation regulation associated with humoral response to vaccination impact known cellular differentiation signaling and antigen presentation pathways. We performed our analysis using per-site and regionally average methylation levels, in addition to continuous or dichotomized outcome measures. The genes and molecular functions implicated by each analysis were compared, highlighting different aspects of the biologic mechanisms of immune response affected by differential methylation. Both cis-acting (within the gene or promoter) and trans-acting (enhancers and transcription factor binding sites) sites show significant associations with measures of humoral immunity. Specifically, we identified a group of CpGs that, when coordinately hypo-methylated, are associated with lower humoral immune response, and methylated with higher response. Additionally, CpGs that individually predict humoral immune responses are enriched for polycomb-group and FOXP2 transcription factor binding sites. The most robust associations implicate differential methylation affecting gene expression levels of genes with known roles in immunity (e.g. HLA-B and HLA-DQB2) and immunosenescence. We believe our data and analysis strategy highlight new and interesting epigenetic trends affecting humoral response to vaccination against influenza; one of the most common and impactful viral pathogens.},

  abstract = {H3N2 viruses continuously acquire mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein that abrogate binding of human antibodies. During the 2014-2015 influenza season, clade 3C.2a H3N2 viruses possessing a new predicted glycosylation site in antigenic site B of HA emerged, and these viruses remain prevalent today. The 2016-2017 seasonal influenza vaccine was updated to include a clade 3C.2a H3N2 strain; however, the egg-adapted version of this viral strain lacks the new putative glycosylation site. Here, we biochemically demonstrate that the HA antigenic site B of circulating clade 3C.2a viruses is glycosylated. We show that antibodies elicited in ferrets and humans exposed to the egg-adapted 2016-2017 H3N2 vaccine strain poorly neutralize a glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. Importantly, antibodies elicited in ferrets infected with the current circulating H3N2 viral strain (that possesses the glycosylation site) and humans vaccinated with baculovirus-expressed H3 antigens (that possess the glycosylation site motif) were able to efficiently recognize a glycosylated clade 3C.2a H3N2 virus. We propose that differences in glycosylation between H3N2 egg-adapted vaccines and circulating strains likely contributed to reduced vaccine effectiveness during the 2016-2017 influenza season. Furthermore, our data suggest that influenza virus antigens prepared via systems not reliant on egg adaptations are more likely to elicit protective antibody responses that are not affected by glycosylation of antigenic site B of H3N2 HA.},

  abstract = {Antibodies targeting the receptor binding site (RBS) of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein are usually not broadly-reactive because their footprints are typically large and extend to nearby variable HA residues. Here, we identified several human H3N2 HA RBS-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that were sensitive to substitutions in conventional antigenic sites and were not broadly-reactive. However, we also identified one H3N2 HA RBS-targeting mAb that was exceptionally broadly reactive despite being sensitive to substitutions in residues outside of the RBS. We determined that similar antibodies are present at measurable levels in the sera of some individuals but that they are inefficiently elicited by conventional vaccines. Our data indicate that some HA RBS-targeting antibodies can be surprisingly effective against variable viral strains even if they are somewhat sensitive to substitutions in HA residues adjacent to the RBS.},
