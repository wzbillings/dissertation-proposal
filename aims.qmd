* Public health impact of outcome
* Physiology/epidemiology of exposure/outcome relationship
* Research gap
* Overall goal

* Influenza is a public health threat and a universal vaccine is the solution to pandemic preparedness.
* Due to host heterogeneity and antigenic drift, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is extremely variable.
* While individual studies have worked on characterizing these effects, we still lack quantitative predictions and we don't understand how these components interact.

Recent concerns about H5N1 influenza spillover events acutely highlight the need
for a universal influenza vaccine with the ability to mitigate future pandemic
events. However, a combination of rapid antigenic evolution and heterogeneity in
individual host responds makes developing such a universal vaccine difficult.
Previous literature has characterized the importance of prior immunity in a
path-dependent context, vaccine design (including dose and route of
administration), and antigenic distance between the vaccine and host strain, but
robust quantitative predictions of these effects is lacking. Our *long-term
goal* is to determine how pre-existing immunity affects individual response to
the seasonal influenza vaccine, and how this effect differs by host factors,
vaccine types, and characteristics of the virus strain used for vaccination.

The objective of our proposal is to focus on antigenic distance between the
vaccine strain and circulating strains, vaccine dose, and prior immunity. We
will utilize state-of-the-art Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques in
conjunction with causal inference and machine learning methodologies to quantify
these effects on the individual immune response to influenza, while taking
complex interaction effects into account. We also propose to develop metrics for
the quantification of the immune response to a panel of antigenically distinct
viruses, an area which has been previously underdeveloped. Our work will
leverage longitudinal influenza vaccination data collected by Ted Ross, Ben Cowling, and other investigators involved with the DIVERsity study (NIH project number 1R01AI170116-01).

<!-- Aim 1: Amanda Ag-Dist project -->
**Aim 1. Develop metrics for the quantification of the total immune response to an influenza vaccine, incorporating both strength and breadth.** We hypothesize that by fitting a curve to the relationship between immune response and antigenic distance from the vaccine data for a study sample tested against multiple potentially cross-protective viruses will allow us to extract information about the fitted curve which quantifies the overall effect of vaccination.

<!-- Aim 2: Unnamed dose project and Veronika's models -->
**Aim 2. Quantify the effect of vaccine dose on the effect of the vaccine after accounting for pre-existing immunity and antigenic distance.** We hypothesize that a higher vaccine dose will be able to overcome the previously observed antigenic ceiling effect induced by pre-existing immunity, and that this relationship will be modulated by the antigenic distance between the vaccine and the strain of interest.

<!-- Aim 3: Yang's strain-specific model vs. antigenic distance model -->
**Aim 3. Determine whether antigenic distance is a sufficient single measurement of difference between viral strains in the context of vaccination.** We hypothesize that the antigenic distance between a vaccine strain and another viral strain provides enough information to predict how an individual will respond to that strain following vaccination.

Our work will leverage previously collected data and powerful statistical models
in order to elucidate patterns in host response and viral evolution which drive
individual immune responses to influenza vaccination. By understanding the
complex network of factors which modulate the response, we can illuminate key
factors for consideration in the development of novel vaccines, and inform
vaccination strategies at relatively low cost. Understanding these complex
factors is essential for strategic planning to curtail future influenza
pandemics.
