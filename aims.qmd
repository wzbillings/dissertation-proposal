# SPECIFIC AIMS

Recent concerns about H5N1 influenza spillover events highlight the need for a
universal influenza vaccine with the ability to mitigate future pandemic events.
Outside of pandemic concerns, seasonal epidemic influenza has a consistently
high burden, with vaccine effectiveness typically 50% or less. A combination of
rapid antigenic evolution and heterogeneity in individual host response makes
developing a durable universal vaccine difficult. The goal of my proposal is to
understand how pre-existing immunity affects individual response to the seasonal
influenza vaccine, and how this effect is modified by prior immunity, vaccination history, vaccine dose, and recipient demographics. A better
understanding of the host immune response will inform the design and evaluation
of vaccines which induce a broader, more robust response.

We will use Bayesian hierarchical models, causal inference, and machine learning
methods to quantify these effects. Our models will account for interactions
between predictors, nonlinear effects, and clustered measurements. We will
analyze longitudinal influenza vaccination data from the UGAFluVac cohort study
(PI: Ross), wherein individuals provided serum samples, potentially for multiple
years, and these samples were tested against a panel of historical viruses. We
will also combine the UGAFluVac data with other data sources provided by Ben
Cowling, Andrea Sant, and potentially other investigators involved with the
DIVERsity study (NIH project number 1R01AI170116-01) or the CIVR-HRP NIH CIVICs
site (NIH project number 75N93019C00052).

<!-- Aim 1: Amanda Ag-Dist project -->
**Aim 1. Develop metrics for the quantification of the total immune response to an influenza vaccine, incorporating both strength and breadth.**
Using the UGAFluVac data, we will analyze the relationship between immune
response and antigenic distance, a measurement of how different the assay
strain and the vaccine strain are. We will develop metrics for quantifying the
overall strength of the immune response to a panel of heterologous strains, and
the breadth of the response -- intuitively, how the immune response diminishes
as antigenic distance increases. We will also use subsamples of the UGAFluVac
data to analyze the robustness of these metrics across differing panels of
historical viruses.

<!-- Aim 2: Unnamed dose project and Veronika's models -->
**Aim 2. Quantify the role of pre-vaccination titer, prior vaccinations, vaccine dose, and antigenic distance on individual vaccine response.**
Influenza vaccinations provide diminishing boosts for recipients with high
antibody titers, called the antibody ceiling effect. However, the threshold
and rate of diminishing boosts depend on several other host and vaccine factors,
including prior vaccination history, vaccine dose, and antigenic distance. We
will use hierarchical statistical models and mechanistic models to disentangle
the individual effects and interactions.

<!-- Aim 3: Yang's strain-specific model vs. antigenic distance model -->
**Aim 3. Explore how age and vaccine dose interact to affect the antibody response.**
The UGAFluVac cohort allows participants over the age of 65 to choose whether
they receive FluZone standard dose or FluZone high dose, and Andrea Sant's
cohort study administered FluZone HD to individuals aged 18 -- 49. By combining
the two datasets, we can use causal inference and hierarchical modeling
techniques to understand the effect of dose, and how this relates to previous
mechanistic modeling predictions.
